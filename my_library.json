  {"id":"acostacruzDreamNationPuerto2014","abstract":"Over the past fifty years, Puerto Rican voters have roundly rejected any calls for national independence. Yet the rhetoric and iconography of independence have been defining features of Puerto Rican literature and culture. In the provocative new book Dream Nation, María Acosta Cruz investigates the roots and effects of this profound disconnect between cultural fantasy and political reality.Bringing together texts from Puerto Rican literature, history, and popular culture, Dream Nation shows how imaginings of national independence have served many competing purposes. They have given authority to the island’s literary and artistic establishment but have also been a badge of countercultural cool. These ideas have been fueled both by nostalgia for an imagined past and by yearning for a better future. They have fostered local communities on the island, and still helped define Puerto Rican identity within U.S. Latino culture.In clear, accessible prose, Acosta Cruz takes us on a journey from the 1898 annexation of Puerto Rico to the elections of 2012, stopping at many cultural touchstones along the way, from the canonical literature of the Generación del 30 to the rap music of Tego Calderón. Dream Nation thus serves both as a testament to how stories, symbols, and heroes of independence have inspired the Puerto Rican imagination and as an urgent warning about how this culture has become detached from the everyday concerns of the island’s people.A volume in the American Literature Initiatives series","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Acosta Cruz","given":"María"}],"citation-key":"acostacruzDreamNationPuerto2014","event-place":"New Brunswick","ISBN":"978-0-8135-6548-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"publisher":"Rutgers University Press","publisher-place":"New Brunswick","source":"Project MUSE","title":"Dream Nation: Puerto Rican Culture and the Fictions of Independence","title-short":"Dream Nation","type":"book","URL":"http://muse.jhu.edu/book/28839"},

  {"id":"acreeDivisasDeberesWomen2013","abstract":"From the outbreak of the wars for independence in the Río de la Plata to the 1910 centennial celebration of independence, color-coded headbands known as divisas served as means of identifying political affiliation, necessary accoutrements for battle, symbols bearing war cries, and powerful icons that attested to and participated in the politicization of popular classes. In most cases divisas were handmade and sewn by wives and mothers, making these ribbons the touch of love that soldiers took into hate-filled fights. The ribbons were also emblems of deberes—duties. Divisas provide a unique index of how popular political sentiment reached deep into Rioplatense society, and they offer a glimpse into the world of female duty in the elaboration of a symbolic economy of war. Through writing with the needle and their central role in the confection of symbols, women not only developed parallel forms of literacy; they also participated in political discourse during wartime that the state could not ignore after the end of battle. Manifestations of the political agency women achieved appear in the impact of female affect, and in the formal, public education of women as model mothers in the home and model teachers in the school.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Acree","given":"William G."}],"citation-key":"acreeDivisasDeberesWomen2013","container-title":"Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies","DOI":"10.1080/13569325.2013.795131","ISSN":"1356-9325","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,1]]},"page":"213-237","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Divisas and Deberes: Women and the Symbolic Economy of War Rhetoric in the Río De La Plata, 1810–1910","title-short":"Divisas and Deberes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13569325.2013.795131","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"AdamsOnisTreaty2021","abstract":"The Adams–Onís Treaty (Spanish: Tratado de Adams-Onís) of 1819, also known as the Transcontinental Treaty, the Florida Purchase Treaty, or the Florida Treaty, was a treaty between the United States and Spain in 1819 that ceded Florida to the U.S. and defined the boundary between the U.S. and New Spain. It settled a standing border dispute between the two countries and was considered a triumph of American diplomacy. It came in the midst of increasing tensions related to Spain's territorial boundaries in North America against the United States and the United Kingdom in the aftermath of the American Revolution; it also came during the Latin American wars of independence.\nFlorida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons, so the Spanish government decided to cede the territory to the United States in exchange for settling the boundary dispute along the Sabine River in Spanish Texas. The treaty established the boundary of U.S. territory and claims through the Rocky Mountains and west to the Pacific Ocean, in exchange for the U.S. paying residents' claims against the Spanish government up to a total of $5 million and relinquishing the U.S. claims on parts of Spanish Texas west of the Sabine River and other Spanish areas, under the terms of the Louisiana Purchase.\nThe treaty remained in full effect for only 183 days: from February 22, 1821, to August 24, 1821, when Spanish military officials signed the Treaty of Córdoba acknowledging the independence of Mexico; Spain repudiated that treaty, but Mexico effectively took control of Spain's former colony. The Treaty of Limits between Mexico and the United States, signed in 1828 and effective in 1832, recognized the border defined by the Adams–Onís Treaty as the boundary between the two nations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,5]]},"citation-key":"AdamsOnisTreaty2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,4]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1026829549","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Adams–Onís Treaty","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs_Treaty&oldid=1026829549"},

  {"id":"akermanCartographyProductionSilencing2017","abstract":"Almost universally, newly independent states seek to affirm their independence and identity by making the production of new maps and atlases a top priority. For formerly colonized peoples, however, this process neither begins nor ends with independence, and it is rarely straightforward. Mapping their own land is fraught with a fresh set of issues: how to define and administer their territories, develop their national identity, establish their role in the community of nations, and more. The contributors to Decolonizing the Map explore this complicated relationship between mapping and decolonization while engaging with recent theoretical debates about the nature of decolonization itself. These essays, originally delivered as the 2010 Kenneth Nebenzahl, Jr., Lectures in the History of Cartography at the Newberry Library, encompass more than two centuries and three continents-Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Ranging from the late eighteenth century through the mid-twentieth, contributors study topics from mapping and national identity in late colonial Mexico to the enduring complications created by the partition of British India and the racialized organization of space in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa. A vital contribution to studies of both colonization and cartography, Decolonizing the Map is the first book to systematically and comprehensively examine the engagement of mapping in the long-and clearly unfinished-parallel processes of decolonization and nation building in the modern world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Akerman","given":"James R."},{"literal":"DeGruyter books online"},{"literal":"Walter de Gruyter & Co"}],"call-number":"GA 108.7 .D44 2018, GA 108.7 .D44 2017eb","citation-key":"akermanCartographyProductionSilencing2017","collection-title":"The Kenneth Nebenzahl Jr. Lectures in the History of Cartography","container-title":"Decolonizing the Map: Cartography from Colony to Nation","event-place":"Chicago","ISBN":"978-0-226-42281-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","page":"50","publisher":"University of Chicago Press, The University of Chicago Press","publisher-place":"Chicago","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Cartography in the Production (and Silencing) of Colombian Independence History, 1807– 1827","type":"chapter","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.degruyter.com/isbn/9780226422817"},

  {"id":"ambrosioHistoricityPeirceClassification2016","abstract":"The classification of the sciences is one of the most discussed and analysed aspects of Peirce’s corpus of work. I propose that Peirce’s attempt at systematising the sciences is characterised by a distinctive historicity, which I construe in two complementary senses. First, I investigate Peirce’s classification as part of a broader nineteenth-century move toward classifying the sciences, a move that was at the same time motivated by social and epistemological goals. I claim that this re-contextualisation adds an entirely new layer to the otherwise distinctively internalist readings of Peirce’s classification. I then look at how Peirce’s scheme, especially in the form it displayed in the early 1890s, relates to his own historical writings, particularly his history of science. Looking at Peirce as a historical actor in his own right through the lens of his classification, I claim, is indispensable to understand the contemporary relevance of his contributions to the history and historiography of the sciences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Ambrosio","given":"Chiara"}],"citation-key":"ambrosioHistoricityPeirceClassification2016","container-title":"European Journal of Pragmatism and American Philosophy","DOI":"10.4000/ejpap.625","ISSN":"2036-4091","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,31]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","number":"2","publisher":"Associazione Pragma","source":"journals.openedition.org","title":"The Historicity of Peirce’s Classification of the Sciences","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.openedition.org/ejpap/625","volume":"VIII"},

While many studies have been written on nationalist political movements, the sense of nationality—the personal and cultural feeling of belonging to the nation—has not received proportionate attention. In this widely acclaimed work, Benedict Anderson examines the creation and global spread of the 'imagined communities' of nationality.  Anderson explores the processes that created these communities: the territorialisation of religious faiths, the decline of antique kingship, the interaction between capitalism and print, the development of vernacular languages-of-state, and changing conceptions of time. He shows how an originary nationalism born in the Americas was modularly adopted by popular movements in Europe, by the imperialist powers, and by the anti-imperialist resistances in Asia and Africa.  This revised edition includes two new chapters, one of which discusses the complex role of the colonialist state's mindset in the development of Third World nationalism, while the other analyses the processes by which all over the world, nations came to imagine themselves as old.","author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Benedict Richard O'Gorman"}],"citation-key":"andersonImaginedCommunitiesReflections1991","ISBN":"978-0-86091-546-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"244","publisher":"Verso","source":"Google Books","title":"Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism","title-short":"Imagined Communities","type":"book"},

His fundamental book influenced also directly the intellectual formation as well as the activities and the writings of some ecclesiastic figures of the time engaged in the corrections and modification of the European presence in the Americas (missionaries, theologians, and reformers of the strategies of evangelization), who dedicated years to the concrete realization of some ideas and projects related to utopian thinking.

Fascinated by Benjamin Franklin's ideas that proclaimed that civilization came from a society of \"self-made men,\" Sarmiento thought it possible to apply such a concept in Argentina to make it the most civilized nation in Latin America. Thus, throughout his presidency, Sarmiento aimed to foster this social change by implementing the ideas of Benjamin Franklin into his nation's young government. Although this explanation is widely accepted in Argentine history, very little research has been done in understanding Sarmiento's methods in adopting and applying Franklin's views to Argentine life. Such research is important as a different implementation of Franklin's ideas could explain Argentina's current societal structure and development, and why it varies from what Franklin had initially envisioned for his own society.

En el contexto de la Edad Media el interés se centra en las convergencias y diferencias entre lo sagrado y lo profano, en la prosa y la lírica del Siglo de Oro se trata la constitución del sujeto y la construcción del yo, mientras que en el teatro se presta atención a la importancia del espacio. Los periodos de transición son objeto de estudio en los siglos XVIII y XIX, las crisis y rupturas lo son en la literatura moderna y contemporánea, y las transiciones, transculturaciones e identidades transitorias vienen tratadas con la atención puesta en Latinoamérica. Además, se incluyen cinco conferencias plenarias y los contenidos de las secciones sobre cine y nuevos medios, sobre historia y cultura entre la participación gubernamental y la oposición, así como sobre la lengua en sus aspectos ideológicos e interactivos.

  {"id":"baezaWiederWiderWeiden","abstract":"Even though the term parody has been studied and identified as a lost genre from older times, contemporary literature has turned it into a creative procedure thanks to one of its most interesting facets: reiteration. In a determinant novel for his global literary project: Estrella distante (1996), the Chilean writer Roberto Bolaño (1953-2003) seems to encode his work in this key. In other words, the novel would not only narrate, in literary terms, the history of a pilot of the Chilean Airforce named Carlos Wieder, who, at the same time, is an artist and a murderer; but also in transtextual terms, according to the explanation by Bibiano O’Ryan (one of the characters), the last name Wieder would be associated with a certain recurrence in Bolaño’s literature: parody as an axis, becoming, simultaneously, mockery and reiteration.","author":[{"family":"Baeza","given":"Felipe Adrián Ríos"}],"citation-key":"baezaWiederWiderWeiden","language":"es","page":"30","source":"Zotero","title":"Wieder, wider, weiden: casos de parodia y autoparodia en la narrativa de Roberto Bolaño","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"baucomHistoryCelsiusSearch2020","abstract":"\"HISTORY 4° CELSIUS links the Anthropocene with the Atlantic slave trade along Ghana's Gold Coast. The slave trade gave birth to a new epoch, an age of modernity that changed both the political and the natural world. The book describes the relationship between Ghana's Gold Coast's slave factories, built to enclose human beings, the New World plantations, and post-emancipation ghettos and post-colonial shanty-towns. The book's title is taken in part from Sartre's \"The Search for Method,\" and in part from a climate change report, \"4°--Turn Down the Heat: Why a 4°C Warmer World Must be Avoided,\" which notes the danger of a \"4° C change above average pre-industrial era temperature levels.\" Ian Baucom begins with the factory system that warehoused human cargo before slave ships set sail. Focusing on one of the 48 slave forts, Fort William in Anomabo, he argues that Ghana is central to understanding the modern world because the finance capital that spanned the globe and could not have come into being without the slave trade. In his previous work, Specters of the Atlantic, Baucom used the story of the British slave ship Zong, in which 133 slaves were thrown overboard in September 1781 so that the ship's owner could file an insurance claim, to illustrate how commoditizing human life formed the basis of an economic cycle that continues today. Going further in this new work, Baucom argues that the conditions that made the Zong episode possible are continuous with those that impact nature today. As the slave trade and the devaluing of life was driven by financial gain, so greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet have their roots in profit. Merging seemingly unrelated threads, Baucom draws from \"Black Atlantic\" imagery of the art world, Marxist thought, Sartrean concepts, and the science of climate change to dissect how evolving political and cultural history and the world's natural history converge to shape modern man as a globally destructive, catastrophic force. He concludes that the modern world can no longer be viewed through the lens of Kant's allegory of a world divided between \"nature\" and its \"political\" opposite. Likewise, freedom cannot be understood as simply physical freedom from slavery but must include the challenge of freedom from exposure to the extreme conditions that climate change produces. While Baucom begins with the historical context of Ghana's slave coast, he ends with his eye on the future, insisting that the day of tyrannical state is over and that the way forward is a radical rethinking of freedom-- not \"freedom from\" but \"freedom toward.\" He challenges the collective disciplines to combine in a \"labor of thought,\" using their methodologies \"for making something of what we have been made.\" Historical, human, and climate forces are not autonomous but interrelated, reinforcing one another\"--","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Baucom","given":"Ian"}],"call-number":"HT 1394 .G48 B38 2020","citation-key":"baucomHistoryCelsiusSearch2020","collection-title":"Theory in forms","contributor":[{"literal":"Walter de Gruyter & Co"}],"event-place":"Durham","ISBN":"978-1-4780-1203-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Duke University Press","publisher-place":"Durham","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"History 4° celsius: search for a method in the age of the Anthropocene","title-short":"History 4° celsius","type":"book","URL":"https://login.proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.degruyter.com/openurl?genre=book&isbn=9781478012030"},

The question at the heart of this introductory chapter takes the challenge of ‘methodological cosmopolitanism’, already addressed in a Special Issue on Cosmopolitan Sociology in this journal (Beck and Sznaider 2006), an important step further: How can social and political theory be opened up, theoretically as well as methodologically and normatively, to a historically new, entangled Modernity which threatens its own foundations? How can it account for the fundamental fragility, the mutability of societal dynamics (of unintended side-effects, domination and power), shaped by the globalization of capital and risks at the beginning of the twenty-first century? What theoretical and methodological problems arise and how can they be addressed in empirical research? In the following, we will develop this ‘cosmopolitan turn’ in four steps: firstly, we present the major conceptual tools for a theory of cosmopolitan modernities; secondly, we de-construct Western modernity by using examples taken from research on individualization and risk; thirdly, we address the key problem of methodological cosmopolitanism, namely the problem of defining the appropriate unit of analysis; and finally, we discuss normative questions, perspectives, and dilemmas of a theory of cosmopolitan modernities, in particular problems of political agency and prospects of political realization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Beck","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Grande","given":"Edgar"}],"citation-key":"beckVarietiesSecondModernity2010","container-title":"The British Journal of Sociology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01320.x","event-place":"Oxford, UK","ISSN":"1468-4446","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","license":"© London School of Economics and Political Science 2010","page":"409-443","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher-place":"Oxford, UK","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Varieties of second modernity: the cosmopolitan turn in social and political theory and research","title-short":"Varieties of second modernity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01320.x","volume":"61"},

  {"id":"benjaminWalterBenjaminArchitecture2009","abstract":"Walter Benjamin is universally recognised as one of the key thinkers of modernity: his writings on politics, language, literature, media, theology and law have had an incalculable influence on contemporary thought. Yet the problem of architecture in and for Benjamin's work remains relatively underexamined. Does Benjamin's project have an architecture and, if so, how does this architecture affect the explicit propositions that he offers us? In what ways are Benjamin's writings centrally caught up with architectural concerns, from the redevelopment of major urban centres to the movements that individuals can make within the new spaces of modern cities? How can Benjamin's theses help us to understand the secret architectures of the present? This volume takes up the architectural challenge in a number of innovative ways, collecting essays by both well-known and emerging scholars on time in cinema, the problem of kitsch, the design of graves and tombs, the orders of road-signs, childhood experience in modern cities, and much more. Engaged, interdisciplinary, bristling with insights, the essays in this collection will constitute an indispensable supplement to the work of Walter Benjamin, as well as providing a guide to some of the obscurities of our own present.","author":[{"family":"Benjamin","given":"Andrew E."},{"family":"Rice","given":"Charles"}],"citation-key":"benjaminWalterBenjaminArchitecture2009","ISBN":"978-0-9805440-9-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"235","publisher":"re.press","source":"Google Books","title":"Walter Benjamin and the Architecture of Modernity","type":"book"},

  {"id":"bentancorMatterEmpireMetaphysics2017","abstract":"The Matter of Empireexamines the philosophical principles invoked by apologists of the Spanish empire that laid the foundations for the material exploitation of the Andean region between 1520 and 1640. Centered on Potosi, Bolivia, Orlando Bentancor's original study ties the colonizers' attempts to justify the abuses wrought upon the environment and the indigenous population to their larger ideology concerning mining, science, and the empire's rightful place in the global sphere. Bentancor points to the underlying principles of scholasticism, particularly in the work of Thomas Aquinas, as the basis of the instrumentalist conception of matter and enslavement, despite the inherent contradictions to moral principles. Bentancor grounds this metaphysical framework in a close reading of sixteenth-century debates on Spanish sovereignty in the Americas and treatises on natural history and mining by theologians, humanists, missionaries, mine owners, jurists, and colonial officials. To Bentancor, their presuppositions were a major turning point for colonial expansion and paved the way to global mercantilism.","author":[{"family":"Bentancor","given":"Orlando"}],"citation-key":"bentancorMatterEmpireMetaphysics2017","collection-title":"Illuminations : cultural formations of the Americas series","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctt1r6b0br","ISBN":"978-0-8229-4460-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of Pittsburgh Press","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"The Matter of Empire: Metaphysics and Mining in Colonial Peru","title-short":"The Matter of Empire","type":"book"},

  {"id":"berardiFuturabilityAgeImpotence2017","abstract":"We live in an age of impotence. Stuck between global war and global finance, between identity and capital, we seem to be incapable of producing the radical change that is so desperately needed. Is there still a way to disentangle ourselves from a global order that shapes our politics as well as our imagination?00In his most systematic book to date, renowned Italian theorist Franco Berardi tackles this question through a solid yet visionary analysis of the three fundamental concepts of Possibility, Potency, and Power. Characterizing Possibility as the content, Potency as the energy, and Power as the form, Berardi suggests that the road to emancipation unravels from the awareness that the field of the possible is only limited, and not created, by the power structures that implement it. Other futures and other worlds are always already inscribed within the present, despite power's attempt at keeping them invisible. Overcoming any temptation of giving in to despair or nostalgia, Berardi proposes the notion of 'futurability' as a way to remind us that even within the darkness of our current crisis lies dormant the horizon of possibility.","author":[{"family":"Berardi","given":"Franco"}],"call-number":"BC 199 .P7 B47 2017","citation-key":"berardiFuturabilityAgeImpotence2017","event-place":"Brooklyn","ISBN":"978-1-78478-743-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Verso Books","publisher-place":"Brooklyn","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Futurability: the age of impotence and the horizon of possibility","title-short":"Futurability","type":"book"},

El suyo es un mundo donde el mal es una fuerza necesaria y las leyes morales son cadenas impuestas al hombre, al que el poeta aspira a liberar a través de la imaginación, la visión y el conocimiento.

A watershed moment for this area of study was the publication of Derrida's Specters of Marx in 1993, marking the inauguration of a \"spectral turn\" in cultural criticism. Gathering together the most compelling texts of the past twenty years, the editors transform the field of spectral studies with this first ever reader, employing the ghost as an analytical and methodological tool. The Spectralities Reader takes ghosts and haunting on their own terms, as wide-ranging phenomena that are not conscripted to a single aesthetic genre or style. Divided into six thematically discreet sections, the reader covers issues of philosophy, politics, media, spatiality, subject formation (gender, race and sexuality), and historiography. It anthologizes the previously published work of theoretical heavyweights from different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds, such as Jacques Derrida, Gayatri Spivak, and Giorgio Agamben, alongside work by literary and cultural historians such as Jeffrey Sconce and Roger Luckhurst\"--","call-number":"PN56.S8 S64 2013","citation-key":"blancoSpectralitiesReaderGhosts2013","editor":[{"family":"Blanco","given":"María del Pilar"},{"family":"Peeren","given":"Esther"}],"event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-4411-3860-6 978-1-4411-0559-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"569","publisher":"Bloomsbury Academic","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The spectralities reader: ghosts and haunting in contemporary cultural theory","title-short":"The spectralities reader","type":"book"},

It focuses on the construction of the Latino identity: a transnational (de Fina & Perrino, 2013), top-down identity, that was created in the 1970s by the Nixon administration. The data for this study comprise the comments posted on a CNN discussion forum in response to Soledad O'Brian's question “What did you think about Latino in America?” A cursory look at the corpus indicated that many Latino participants felt insulted arguing CNN – with its focus on illegal Latinos – had presented the community in a bad light. Thus, transnational identities and the internet, crucially related to globalization, come together in this study. Results show that conflict talk plays a major role in the construction of intragroup dissociation both thematically and at the microlevel. Furthermore, the fact that complex selective dissociation (Garcia-Bedolla, 2003), rather than simpler dis/affiliation processes routinely associated with the construction of social identities (van Dijk 1998) is more at play in the corpus seems to confirm the need for complexity in the study of culture and identity (Blommaert, 2013a).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Blitvich","given":"Pilar Garcés-Conejos"}],"citation-key":"blitvichGlobalizationTransnationalIdentities2018","container-title":"Journal of Pragmatics","container-title-short":"Journal of Pragmatics","DOI":"10.1016/j.pragma.2018.02.001","ISSN":"0378-2166","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"120-133","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Globalization, transnational identities, and conflict talk: The superdiversity and complexity of the Latino identity","title-short":"Globalization, transnational identities, and conflict talk","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216617305799","volume":"134"},

However, while the World’s Fairs addressed the nation-states of high industrialism, cultural technologies are the features used in a post-industrialized context, where it is more important to impress with abilities of symbolic production rather than with traditional industrial production. In terms of modernization processes, it can be argued that the increased emphasis on symbolic production indicates a shift from techno-industrial modernization to techno-cultural modernization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Bolin","given":"Göran"}],"citation-key":"bolinVisionsEuropeCultural2006","container-title":"International Journal of Cultural Studies","container-title-short":"International Journal of Cultural Studies","DOI":"10.1177/1367877906064030","ISSN":"1367-8779, 1460-356X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,6]]},"language":"en","page":"189-206","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Visions of Europe: Cultural technologies of nation-states","title-short":"Visions of Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1367877906064030","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"briggsStudentPoliticalMetaphor2017","abstract":"Miguel José Sanz and José Domingo Díaz’s El Semanario de Caracas (1810–1811) lived and died with the ill-fated first Venezuelan republic. An attorney and a member of the colonial elite, Sanz (1756–1814) tended to characterize the Venezuelan public as political beginners in need of extra instruction and to posit the Semanario as their textbook. Reading Sanz in the context of the tumultuous events and swirling opinions in Venezuela, I analyse the advantages and limitations of the student as a conceptual frame for the newly independent republic. I argue that the teacher–student gap that twentieth-century critics identified as an essential trope for the rhetoric of educational reform is embedded in the discourse of Sanz and his contemporaries. Positing himself as a political teacher who wishes to make the public see recent events from his, very different, perspective, Sanz becomes a political version of the educational reformer.\nAlternate abstract:\nEl Semanario de Caracas (1810–1811) de Miguel José Sanz y José Domingo Díaz nace y muere con la infausta primera república venezolana. Como abogado perteneciente a la elite colonial, Sanz (1756–1814) solía describir al pueblo venezolano como principiantes políticos a quienes les faltaba más instrucción; y proponía su periódico como el libro de texto apropiado. En este trabajo se analizará las ventajas y desventajas del estudiante como metáfora conceptual para la república naciente. Este análisis dependerá de una lectura de las opiniones de Sanz con relación a los eventos tumultuosos de espectadores en Venezuela. Se argumenta que el golfo estructural entre maestro y estudiante que los críticos del siglo veinte identificaron como tropo esencial de la retórica de la reforma educativa también se ve incrustado en el discurso de Sanz y sus contemporáneos. Proponiéndose como maestro político que quiere transmitir su propia y distinta perspectiva al pueblo, Sanz se convierte en una versión política del reformador educativo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Briggs","given":"Ronald"}],"citation-key":"briggsStudentPoliticalMetaphor2017","container-title":"Bulletin of Hispanic Studies","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3828/bhs.2017.33","event-place":"Liverpool, United Kingdom","ISSN":"14753839","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"English","license":"Copyright Liverpool University Press 2017","number-of-pages":"513-528","page":"513-528","publisher":"Liverpool University Press","publisher-place":"Liverpool, United Kingdom","source":"ProQuest","title":"The Student as Political Metaphor in El Semanario de Caracas (1810-1811)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.proquest.com/docview/1904772455/abstract/AB564B08C9114493PQ/1","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"brinkmanPoeticModernismCulture2016","abstract":"\"In Poetic Modernism in the Culture of Mass Print, Bartholomew Brinkman argues that an emerging mass print culture conditioned the production, reception, and institutionalization of poetic modernism from the latter part of the nineteenth century through the middle of the twentieth century--with lasting implications for the poetry and media landscape. Drawing upon extensive archival research in the United States and Britain, Brinkman demonstrates that a variety of print collecting practices--including the anthology, the periodical, the collage poem, volumes of selected and collected poems, and the modern poetry archive--helped structure key formal and institutional sites of poetic modernism. Brinkman focuses on the generative role of book collecting practices and the negotiation of print ephemera in scrapbooks. He also traces the evolution of the modern poetry archive as a particular case of the mid-twentieth-century rise of literary archives and identifies parallels between the beginning of mass print culture at the end of the nineteenth century and the growth of digital culture today. Advocating for a transatlantic modernism that stretches roughly from 1880 to 1960--one that incorporates both popular and canonical poets--Brinkman successfully extends the geographical, historical, and vertical dimensions of modernist studies. Poetic Modernism in the Culture of Mass Print will appeal not only to scholars and students of literary modernism, modern periodical studies, book history, print culture, media studies, history, art history, and museum studies but also to librarians, archivists, museum curators, and information science professionals\"--","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Brinkman","given":"Bartholomew"}],"call-number":"PS 228 .M63 B75 2016, PS 228 .M63 B75 2017","citation-key":"brinkmanPoeticModernismCulture2016","collection-title":"Hopkins Studies in Modernism","contributor":[{"literal":"Project Muse"}],"event-place":"Baltimore","ISBN":"978-1-4214-2135-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Johns Hopkins University Press","publisher-place":"Baltimore","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Poetic modernism in the culture of mass print","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/48706/"},

In particular, how a radical step-change, caused by intellectual technologies emerging from the Industrial Revolution, stimulated new systems of mass democratization that, in turn, were to transform our notions of individual freedom and social cohesion. In this context it considers design to be a key agent in the production and co-production of useful things and meaningful interactions with the latter gathering influence in a post-industrial society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"brownStateDesign2012","container-title":"The Design Journal","DOI":"10.2752/175630612X13258652805013","ISSN":"1460-6925","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,1]]},"page":"153-167","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The State of Design","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.2752/175630612X13258652805013","volume":"15"},

Hegel, Haiti, and Universal History offers a fundamental reinterpretation of Hegel's master-slave dialectic and points to a way forward to free critical theoretical practice from the prison-house of its own debates. Historicizing the thought of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and the actions taken in the Haitian Revolution, Buck-Morss examines the startling connections between the two and challenges us to widen the boundaries of our historical imagination. She finds that it is in the discontinuities of historical flow, the edges of human experience, and the unexpected linkages between cultures that the possibility to transcend limits is discovered. It is these flashes of clarity that open the potential for understanding in spite of cultural differences. What Buck-Morss proposes amounts to a \"new humanism,\" one that goes beyond the usual ideological implications of such a phrase to embrace a radical neutrality that insists on the permeability of the space between opposing sides and as it reaches for a common humanity.--publisher description.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Buck-Morss","given":"Susan"}],"call-number":"B 2948 .B845 2009","citation-key":"buck-morssHegelHaitiUniversal2009","collection-title":"Illuminations (Pittsburgh, Pa.)","event-place":"Pittsburgh, Pa.","ISBN":"978-0-8229-7334-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of Pittsburgh Press","publisher-place":"Pittsburgh, Pa.","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Hegel, Haiti and Universal history","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctt7zwbgz"},

  {"id":"burgerTheoryAvantgarde1984","abstract":"\"Peter Bürger's Theory of the Avant-Garde sets before English-language readers for the first time a fully elaborated theory of the 'institution of art.' He argues that the social history of literature and art cannot be explained by making simple, direct links between the contents of individual works and social history. Rather, he holds, it is the social status of art, its function and prestige in society, that provides the connection between the individual art work and history. Bürger's concept of the institution of art establishes a framework within which a work of art is both produced and received. The French and German literary and visual avant-garde of the 1920s provides the test of Bürger's theory. Focusing on the role of the artistic manifesto and, particularly, on the collage as an art form, he shows how avant-garde movements questioned the autonomous, self-referential status of art in bourgeois society and thus represented a radical break with the aestheticism of high modernism. Bürger attacks metaphysical aesthetics and argues instead for a materialistic aesthetic theory for today, one that is rooted in the reality of the social sphere. His theory calls into question any conventional concept of art derived from Romantic notions of organic unity. As such, Bürger's arguments should have a major impact on Anglo-American literary theory and its view of historical avant-garde movements like Futurism, Dadaism, and Surrealism, and will be of interest to scholars and students of literature, the visual arts, and the sociology of culture in general.\" -- Provided by publisher","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Bürger","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"burgerTheoryAvantgarde1984","collection-title":"Theory and history of literature","contributor":[{"family":"Schulte-Sasse","given":"Jochen"}],"event-place":"Minneapolis","ISBN":"978-0-8166-1067-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[1984]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 9577163","number-of-pages":"135","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","publisher-place":"Minneapolis","title":"Theory of the avant-garde","translator":[{"family":"Shaw","given":"Michael"}],"type":"book"},

  {"id":"burnardSlaveryNewHistory2020","abstract":"The new history of capitalism (NHC) places a great deal of emphasis on slavery as a crucial world institution. Slavery, it is alleged, arose out of, and underpinned, capitalist development. This article starts by showing the intellectual and scholarly foundations of some of the broad conclusions of the NHC. It proceeds by arguing that capitalist transformation must rely on a global framework of analysis. The article considers three critiques in relation to the NHC. First, the NHC overemphasizes the importance of coercion to economic growth in the eighteenth century. We argue that what has been called ‘war capitalism’ might be better served by an analysis in which the political economy of European states and empires, rather than coercion, is a key factor in the transformation of capitalism at a global scale. Second, in linking slavery to industrialization, the NHC proposes a misleading chronology. Cotton produced in large quantities in the United States came too late to cause an Industrial Revolution which, we argue, developed gradually from the latter half of the seventeenth century and which was well established by the 1790s, when cotton started to arrive from the American South. During early industrialization, sugar, not cotton, was the main plantation crop in the Americas. Third, the NHC is overly concentrated on production and especially on slave plantation economies. It underplays the ‘power of consumption’, where consumers came to purchase increasing amounts of plantation goods, including sugar, rice, indigo, tobacco, cotton, and coffee. To see slavery’s role in fostering the preconditions of industrialization and the Great Divergence, we must tell a story about slavery’s place in supporting the expansion of consumption, as well as a story about production","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Burnard","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Riello","given":"Giorgio"}],"citation-key":"burnardSlaveryNewHistory2020","container-title":"Journal of Global History","DOI":"10.1017/S1740022820000029","ISSN":"1740-0228, 1740-0236","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"language":"en","page":"225-244","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Slavery and the new history of capitalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/slavery-and-the-new-history-of-capitalism/6885E5697E7151B50FDEFC65ED96C79E","volume":"15"},

The early 19th century dissolution of the viceroyalties of Peru & Rio de la Plata involved two cycles: the failed attempt to restore the Incan monarchy & the arrival of Bolivar in Peru. Both occurred at the same time as the emergence of the Creole nation which had a system of government that was between a monarch & a republic but did not have a clearly defined territory. The Unitarian party based in the enlightened elite from Buenos Aires & the Federal party that represented the provincial elite associated with gaucho culture & an inclusive democracy are the two guiding fictions Shumway identified with the creation of Argentina.

Imagined Communities stimulated attention to the dynamics of socially and culturally organized imagination as processes at the heart of political culture, self-understanding and solidarity. This has an influence beyond the study of nationalism as a major innovation in understanding ‘social imaginaries’.

  {"id":"callinicosRoutledgeHandbookMarxism2020","abstract":"In the past two decades, Marxism has enjoyed a revitalization as a research program and a growth in its audience. This renaissance is connected to the revival of anti-capitalist contestation since the Seattle protests in 1999 and the impact of the global economic and financial crisis in 2007–8. It intersects with the emergence of Post-Marxism since the 1980s represented by thinkers such as Jürgen Habermas, Chantal Mouffe, Ranajit Guha and Alain Badiou. This handbook explores the development of Marxism and Post-Marxism, setting them in dialogue against a truly global backdrop. Transcending the disciplinary boundaries between philosophy, economics, politics and history, an international range of expert contributors guide the reader through the main varieties and preoccupations of Marxism and Post-Marxism. Through a series of framing and illustrative essays, readers will explore these traditions, starting from Marx and Engels themselves, through the thinkers of the Second and Third Internationals (Rosa Luxemburg, Lenin and Trotsky, among others), the Tricontinental, and Subaltern and Post-Colonial Studies, to more contemporary figures such as Huey Newton, Fredric Jameson, Judith Butler, Immanuel Wallerstein and Samir Amin. The Routledge Handbook of Marxism and Post-Marxism will be of interest to scholars and researchers of philosophy, cultural studies and theory, sociology, political economics and several areas of political science, including political theory, Marxism, political ideologies and critical theory.","author":[{"family":"Callinicos","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Kouvelakis","given":"Stathis"},{"family":"Pradella","given":"Lucia"}],"citation-key":"callinicosRoutledgeHandbookMarxism2020","ISBN":"978-1-351-37001-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,29]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"722","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Google Books","title":"Routledge Handbook of Marxism and Post-Marxism","type":"book"},

  {"id":"cameronStrongConstitutionsSocialCognitive2015","abstract":"The separation of powers is an idea with ancient origins, but nowadays it is largely relegated to legal doctrine, public philosophy, or the history of ideas. Yet the concept is often evoked in debates on the 'war' on terrorism, the use of emergency powers, or constitutional reform. Strong Constitutions boldly places the separation of powers on a social scientific footing, arguing that it emerged with the spread of literacy, became central to constitutional thought after the Gutenberg revolution, and faces unprecedented challenges in our current era of electronic communication. Constitutional states use texts to coordinate collective action, and they do so by creating governmental agencies with specific jurisdiction and competence over distinct types of power. Among them are the power to make decisions backed by legally sanctioned coercion; the deliberative power to make procedurally legitimate laws; and the judicial power to interpret and apply laws in particular circumstances.The division of government into three such branches enables state officials and citizens to use written texts-legal codes and documents, including constitutions-along with unwritten rules and conventions to coordinate their activities on larger scales and over longer time horizons. Cameron argues that constitutional states are not weaker because their powers are separated. They are generally stronger because they solve collective action problems rooted in speech and communication. The book is a must read for anyone interested in the separation of powers, its origin, evolution, and consequences.","author":[{"family":"Cameron","given":"Maxwell A."}],"citation-key":"cameronStrongConstitutionsSocialCognitive2015","ISBN":"978-0-19-023522-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,3]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"270","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Strong Constitutions: Social-Cognitive Origins of the Separation of Powers","title-short":"Strong Constitutions","type":"book"},

Placing the evolution of conceptualism within the history of Latin American culture, he explores conceptualism as a strategy, rather than a style, in Latin American culture. He shows how the roots of conceptualism reach back to the early nineteenth century in the work of Simon Rodriguez, Simon Bolivar's tutor. Camnitzer then follows conceptualism to the point where art crossed into politics, as with the Argentinian group Tucuman arde in 1968, and where politics crossed into art, as with the Tupamaro movement in Uruguay during the 1960s and early 1970s","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Camnitzer","given":"Luis"}],"citation-key":"camnitzerConceptualismLatinAmerican2007a","collection-title":"Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long series in Latin American and Latino art and culture","event-place":"Austin","ISBN":"978-0-292-71639-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 85783314","number-of-pages":"347","publisher":"University of Texas Press","publisher-place":"Austin","title":"Conceptualism in Latin American Art: didactics of liberation","title-short":"Conceptualism","type":"book"},

  {"id":"camnitzerLuisCamnitzerHospicio2018","abstract":"This retrospective offers a global, contextualised view of Luis Camnitzer's multi-faceted work, spanning nearly sixty years. As an essayist, art critic, curator, teacher, lecturer and a creator of objects, actions and musical compositions, Camnitzer focuses on art's transformative capacity, viewing it essentially as a product of reflection. His practice, whether it be artistic, or through his essays or teaching, is defined by its approach to the controversial issues of our times: the criticism of art-commodity, the demystification and obsolescence of the role of the artist in consumer society, the strategies power uses to impose its logic and perpetuate its control, or the capacity of neoliberal societies to turn education into an instrument of propaganda and thus render it irrelevant, all through the signifying role of language, with its ambiguities and arbitrariness, and images' power to evoke.

These patterns mark the founding of the United States through the European rapist genocide of Indigenous peoples and theft of land, as well as the rapism at the core of chattel slavery.

  {"id":"castagnoLatinamericanism2015","abstract":"This review-essay analyses John Beverley's post-subalternist perspective on the intertwinement of theoretical discourse and politics--so-called Latinamericanism--in the Latin American context. This conjuncture is characterised by the marea rosada, or pink tide, of moderate leftist governments. I contend that Beverley grasps the change introduced by this trend and lucidly criticises the neoconservative, moderate, and deficient political implications of different theoretical views. This contribution notwithstanding, I argue that Beverley's theoretical project fails effectively to conceptualise this political tide as an object of theoretical inquiry: namely, to grapple with the marea rosada's Latinamericanism as a populist political logic that simultaneously neutralises and drives socialist transformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Castagno","given":"Pablo"}],"citation-key":"castagnoLatinamericanism2015","container-title":"Historical Materialism","container-title-short":"Historical Materialism","DOI":"10.1163/1569206X-12341393","ISSN":"14654466","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,3]]},"page":"243-264","publisher":"Brill Academic Publishers","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"Inside Latinamericanism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=102372855&site=ehost-live","volume":"23"},

Demuestra cómo los deseos\n\t\tterritoriales y políticos de los líderes pro-independentistas (que a su vez no\n\t\testuvieron de acuerdo en cuanto a qué forma debería tener la república en la\n\t\tpráctica) fueron además restringidos por los intereses imperiales de la Gran\n\t\tBretaña. Por lo tanto, la geopolítica y los intereses diplomáticos jugaron un\n\t\tpapel primordial a la hora de determinar la manera como se representó la extensión\n\t\tde la Gran Colombia durante este periodo en Londres. El considerar los\n\t\tmateriales visuales y geográficos producidos dentro de este complejo contexto\n\t\ttransnacional nos ayudará a entender aspectos poco examinados por los estudiosos\n\t\tde la historia de la ciencia y de la cultura visual sobre América a principios\n\t\tdel siglo XIX.

He notes that Weisman's experiment tellingly demonstrates how the current crisis can precipitate a sense of the present that disconnects the future from the past by putting such a future beyond the grasp of historical sensibility. Moreover, Chakrabarty presents some of the responses to the contemporary crisis from a historian's point of view. Also, he presents his propositions in the form of four theses.

  {"id":"chambersSwedenborgianInfluenceWilliam1995","abstract":"The aim of the thesis is to examine the Blake-Swedenborg connection, and the influence this Swede's writings may have had on Blake's published work. In particular The Songs of Innocence and of Experience and The Marriage of Heaven and Hell are considered in detail to assess a Swedenborgian influence. Also discussed are the annotations Blake made to his copies of Swedenborg's works, namely Heaven and Hell, Divine Love and Wisdom, and Divine Providence. A survey is made of the important literature expressing the Blakean perspective and the Swedenborgian perspective on the relationship. Blake's ambivalence towards Swedenborg is noted in the various periods of his life. The principal Swedenborgian symbols used by Blake are analysed.\n\nTo set this examination in a Swedenborgian historical context, the development of the early New Church is briefly recorded, showing the links Blake had with Swedenborgian friends and Patrons. A detailed study is made of the Propositions placed before the first General Conference of the New Church and what might have been Blake's reactions to them as he attended the Conference.\n\nThe thesis concludes with a discussion of the use of the word 'influence', both directly and indirectly as it applies to the Blake-Swedenborg connection. It is accepted that Blake was influenced directly for at least a part of his life by his Swedenborgian reading, and that the ideas gathered were never completely dismissed by him.\n\nAs a contribution to the continuing study of the Blake- Swedenborg connection, archival material, and sketches and portraits of personalities known to Blake, who had strong Swedenborgian links, are gathered from many world wide locations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Chambers","given":"Leslie"}],"citation-key":"chambersSwedenborgianInfluenceWilliam1995","genre":"phd","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"399","publisher":"The Open University","source":"oro.open.ac.uk","title":"The Swedenborgian influence on William Blake","type":"thesis","URL":"http://oro.open.ac.uk/57405/"},

  {"id":"cheahSpectralNationality2003","abstract":"This far-ranging and ambitious attempt to rethink postcolonial theory's discussion of the nation and nationalism brings the\nproblems of the postcolonial condition to bear on the philosophy of freedom. Closely identified with totalitarianism and\nfundamentalism, the nation-state has a tainted history of coercion, ethnic violence, and even, as in ultranationalist Nazi Germany,\ngenocide. Most contemporary theorists are therefore skeptical, if not altogether dismissive, of the idea of the nation and the\nrelated metaphor of the political body as an organism. Going\nagainst orthodoxy, Pheng Cheah retraces the universal-rationalist foundations and progressive origins of political organicism in the work of Kant and its development in philosophers in the German\ntradition such as Fichte, Hegel, and Marx. Cheah argues that the\nwidespread association of freedom with the self-generating dynamism of life and culture's power of transcendence is the most important legacy of this tradition. Addressing this legacy's manifestations in Fanon and Cabral's theories of anticolonial struggle and\ncontemporary anticolonial literature, including the Buru Quartet by Indonesian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer, and the Kenyan writer\nNgugi Wa Thiong'o's nationalist novels, Cheah suggests that the\nprofound difficulties of achieving freedom in the postcolonial\nworld indicate the need to reconceptualize freedom in terms of the figure of the specter rather than the living organism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,11]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"CHEAH","given":"PHENG"}],"citation-key":"cheahSpectralNationality2003","DOI":"10.7312/chea13018","ISBN":"null","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Columbia University Press","title":"Spectral Nationality","type":"book","URL":"www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/chea13018"},

  {"id":"clarkeFAIRshakeToolkitEvaluate2019","abstract":"As more datasets, tools, workflows, APIs, and other digital resources are produced by the research community, it is becoming increasingly difficult to harmonize and organize these efforts for maximal synergistic integrated utilization. The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guiding principles have prompted many stakeholders to consider strategies for tackling this challenge by making these digital resources follow common standards and best practices so that they can become more integrated and organized. Faced with the question of how to make digital resources more FAIR, it has become imperative to measure what it means to be FAIR. The diversity of resources, communities, and stakeholders have different goals and use cases and this makes assessment of FAIRness particularly challenging. To begin resolving this challenge, the FAIRshake toolkit was developed to enable the establishment of community-driven FAIR metrics and rubrics paired with manual, semi- and fully-automated FAIR assessment capabilities. The FAIRshake toolkit contains a database that lists registered digital resources, with their associated metrics, rubrics, and assessments. The FAIRshake toolkit also has a browser extension and a bookmarklet that enables viewing and submitting assessments from any website. The FAIR assessment results are visualized as an insignia that can be viewed on the FAIRshake website, or embedded within hosting websites. Using FAIRshake, a variety of bioinformatics tools, datasets listed on dbGaP, APIs registered in SmartAPI, workflows in Dockstore, and other biomedical digital resources were manually and automatically assessed for FAIRness. In each case, the assessments revealed room for improvement, which prompted enhancements that significantly upgraded FAIRness scores of several digital resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Clarke","given":"Daniel J.

  {"id":"collierModernPrintArtefacts2016","abstract":"Demonstrates the ways in which print artefacts asserted and contested literary value in the modernist period. This study focuses on the close connections between literary value and the materiality of popular print artefacts in Britain from 1890-1930. The book demonstrates that the materiality of print objects - paper quality, typography, spatial layout, use of illustrations, etc. - became uniquely visible and significant in these years, as a result of a widely perceived crisis in literary valuation. In a set of case studies, it analyses the relations between literary value, meaning, and textual materiality in print artefacts such as newspapers, magazines, and book genres - artefacts that gave form to both literary works and the journalistic content (critical essays, book reviews, celebrity profiles, and advertising) through which conflicting conceptions of literature took shape. In the process, it corrects two available misperceptions about reading in the period: that books were the default mode of reading, and that experimental modernism was the sole literary aesthetic that could usefully represent modern life. Key FeaturesGives readers access to a sphere of literary production and reception that is virtually unexamined by existing scholarshipProvides a fresh view of literary production and the print marketplace by refusing to foreground literary modernism as a critical lens. Instead, it focuses on more widely read and accessible print artefacts, including the Illustrated London News in the 1890s; the London Mercury; John O'London's Weekly; and the poetry anthology as a book genreThe book constitutes a simultaneously historical and theoretical inquiry into the workings of literary value","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Collier","given":"Patrick"}],"call-number":"Z 8 .G7 C65 2016eb, Z 8 .G7 C65 2016","citation-key":"collierModernPrintArtefacts2016","collection-title":"Edinburgh critical studies in modernist culture","contributor":[{"literal":"JSTOR"}],"event-place":"Edinburgh","ISBN":"978-1-4744-1348-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University Press","publisher-place":"Edinburgh","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Modern print artefacts: textual materiality and literary value in British print culture, 1890-1930s","title-short":"Modern print artefacts","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g051pn"},

  {"id":"ColumbianPress2021","abstract":"The Columbian press was invented by George Clymer, probably in 1813, inspired in some measure by the earlier Stanhope press. It was designed to allow large formes, such as a broadsheet newspaper page, to be printed at a single pull. The press worked by a lever system, similar to that of the Stanhope press and quite different from the toggle action of the slightly later English Albion press. Clymer's new iron press was first advertised in April 1814.\nAlthough Clymer manufactured and sold a few presses in America, he found the market difficult and moved in 1817 to London, where he began a successful manufacturing programme that lasted well into the twentieth century, initially with operations at 1 Finsbury Street, London.  In 1830, Clymer joined in a partnership with Samuel Dixon, trading as Clymer, Dixon and Co and moving down the street to 10 Finsbury Street, London.  Clymer pursued various business partnerships between 1830 and 1849 before dissolving the partnership; in 1851, the business was taken over by William Carpenter, the first of many takeovers. Nonetheless, the Columbian press continued to be manufactured into the twentieth century and was also manufactured in various European industrial centres.\nThe press is sometimes, incorrectly, referred to as the 'Eagle' press due to the characteristic bald eagle counterweight which usually sits on the top lever. Some Columbians have the counterweight in another form; for example, a simple ornament, a lamp, urn, or orb.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,7]]},"citation-key":"ColumbianPress2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,13]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1017578448","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Columbian press","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Columbian_press&oldid=1017578448"},

  {"id":"ColumbusLetterFirst2021","abstract":"Columbus's letter on the first voyage is the first known document announcing the results of the first voyage of Christopher Columbus that set out in 1492 and reached the Americas. The letter was ostensibly written by Columbus himself, on February 15, 1493, aboard the caravel Niña, while still at sea, on the return leg of his voyage. A post-script was added upon his arrival in Lisbon on March 4, 1493, and it was probably from there that Columbus dispatched two copies of his letter to the Spanish court.\nThe letter was instrumental in spreading the news throughout Europe about Columbus's voyage. Almost immediately after Columbus's arrival in Spain, printed versions of the letter began to appear. A Spanish version of the letter (presumably addressed to Luis de Santángel), was printed in Barcelona by early April 1493, and a Latin translation (addressed to Gabriel Sanchez) was published in Rome around a month later (ca. May 1493). The Latin version was swiftly disseminated and reprinted in many other locations—Basel, Paris, Antwerp, etc.—still within the first year of his arrival.\nIn his letter, Christopher Columbus claimed to have discovered and taken possession of a series of islands on the edge of the Indian Ocean in Asia—Columbus was not aware that he had stumbled upon a new continent. He described the islands, particularly Hispaniola and Cuba, exaggerating their size and wealth, and suggested that mainland China probably lay nearby. He also gave a brief description of the native Arawaks (whom he called \"Indians\"), emphasizing their docility and amenability, and the prospects of their conversion to Catholicism. However, the letter also revealed local rumors about a fierce man-eating tribe of \"monsters\" in the area (probably Caribs), although Columbus himself disbelieved the stories, and dismissed them as a myth. The letter provides very few details of the oceanic voyage itself, and covers up the loss of the flagship of his fleet, the Santa María, by suggesting Columbus left it behind with some colonists, in a fort he erected at La Navidad in Hispaniola. In the letter, Columbus urges the Catholic monarchs to sponsor a second, larger expedition to the Indies, promising to bring back immense riches.\nA slightly different version of Columbus's letter, in manuscript form, addressed to the Catholic monarchs of Spain, was found in 1985, part of the Libro Copiador collection, and has led to some revision of the history of the Columbus letter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,1]]},"citation-key":"ColumbusLetterFirst2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,13]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1006526034","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Columbus's letter on the first voyage","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Columbus%27s_letter_on_the_first_voyage&oldid=1006526034"},

  {"id":"coronadoWorldNotCome2013","abstract":"\"A shift of global proportions occurred in May 1808. Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain and deposed the Spanish king. Overnight, the Hispanic world was transformed forever. Hispanics were forced to confront modernity, and to look beyond monarchy and religion for new sources of authority. A World Not to Come focuses on how Spanish Americans in Texas used writing as a means to establish new sources of authority, and how a Latino literary and intellectual life was born in the New World. The geographic locale that became Texas changed sovereignty four times, from Spanish colony to Mexican republic to Texan republic and finally to a U.S. state. Following the trail of manifestos, correspondence, histories, petitions, and periodicals, Raúl Coronado goes to the writings of Texas Mexicans to explore how they began the slow process of viewing the world as no longer being a received order but a produced order. Through reconfigured publics, they debated how best to remake the social fabric even as they were caught up in a whirlwind of wars, social upheaval, and political transformations. Yet, while imagining a new world, Texas Mexicans were undergoing a transformation from an elite community of \"civilizing\" conquerors to an embattled, pauperized, racialized group whose voices were annihilated by war. In the end, theirs was a world not to come. Coronado sees in this process of racialization the birth of an emergent Latino culture and literature.\"--Publisher's website.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Coronado","given":"Raúl"}],"call-number":"PS 153 .H56 C68 2013eb, PS 153 .H56 C68 2013","citation-key":"coronadoWorldNotCome2013","contributor":[{"literal":"JSTOR"}],"event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-674-07391-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"A World Not to Come: a History of Latino Writing and Print Culture","title-short":"A World Not to Come","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctt32b6p6"},

  {"id":"Cosmogram2023","abstract":"A cosmogram depicts a cosmology in a flat geometric form. They are used for various purposes: meditational, inpirational and to depict structure -- real or imagined -- of the earth or universe.Often, cosmograms feature a circle and a square, or a circle and a cross. The circle may represent the universe, or unity, or an explanation of the universe in its totality - whether inspired by religious beliefs or scientific knowledge. The square or cross may represent the Earth, the four directions. The centre may represent the individual.Many diagrams featuring circles and squares or crosses may be interpreted as cosmograms, although they may not be intentionally created as such. For example, traditional Chinese coins that are round with a square hole in the middle, have been given such an interpretation, and so has the board for the game ludo, see Cross and Circle game. \nExamples   \nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the framework of a traditional cosmogram is used to reflect on a particular person, persons or cultures. Often public buildings and parks host the cosmogram permanently. Examples include a memorial at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, which commemorates the center's namesake and Langston Hughes, who during his lifetime lived near the plot of land where the center was constructed.   \nStrawberry Fields, the memorial for John Lennon in Central Park fits the criteria for a cosmogram: a pattern inside the border of a circle with an inner circle inscribed \"Imagine\".Hindi and Buddhist mandalas are cosmograms, but similar diagrams, known as schema, were also used in western Europe during the Middle Ages.\nThe Kôngo cosmogram represents the man's origin, destiny, and path to salvation.Architectural cosmograms -- ancient city planning employed by the Aztec, Mayan and Mesopotamian cultures -- used structures to reflect the cosmos.The basement floor of First African Baptist Church in Savannah, GA has a Congolese cosmogram made of drilled holes in the shape of a diamond with an inner cross. This is a prayer cosmogram depicting birth, life, death and rebirth. There is speculation that this cosmogram is made of drilled holes in a floor because American slaves hid in underneath the panels and needed air holes for circulation.Scholars argue cosmograms appear in performance, citing the concept albums of George Clinton's bands Parliament and Funkadelic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,2]]},"citation-key":"Cosmogram2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,2]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1136974209","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Cosmogram","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cosmogram&oldid=1136974209#cite_note-1"},
  {"id":"CosmoramaPintura2021","abstract":"Cosmorama (de las dos griegas χοςμος, mundo, universo, y χοραμα, vista) es la representación de paisajes, monumentos, edificios, poblaciones, escenas de la naturaleza, etc. en cuadros vistos por un vidrio óptico. \n\nEl cosmorama, cuando está bien dispuesto, cuando las pinturas se hallan ejecutadas con maestría y bien alumbradas produce un efecto que ilusiona la vista fingiéndole realidad donde no hay más que colorido. Mucho se generalizaron los cosmoramas en el siglo XIX pero pocos merecen el nombre de tales pues no se componen generalmente más que de estampas mal iluminadas colocadas detrás de un vidrio lenticular. Los buenos espectáculos ópticos en este género eran muy escasos porque no basta para conseguir grandes efectos tener a mano un vidrio y una pintura. Es necesario que esta sea debida a un pincel maestro, que la perspectiva sea rigurosa y tales las proporciones que no aparezcan luego desfigurados o gigantescos los objetos, corno lo hemos visto con muchos llamados cosmoramas. \n\nCuando el ojo del observador y el cuadro están fuera de los focos del vidrio lenticular, hay inversión, y entonces la pintura ha de colocarse de manera que aparezca en posición recia; es el caso más favorable para poder alumbrar bien un cosmorama; pero es mucho más sencillo poner el cuadro dentro del foco, porque así no hay necesidad de invertirlo. El cosmorama que más celebridad adquirió fue el que fundó en París el abate Gazzera; se abrió en 1º de enero de 1808 y presentó su última exposición en 1832. El abate se propuso poner de manifiesto los sitios y monumentos más notables de la tierra y empezó por Asia. La mayor parte de los cuadros fueron pintados por los más célebres artistas, llegando con el tiempo a reunirse una colección de 800 vistas, de las cuales figuraban 72 en cada exposición. Al principio era el tamaño de los cuadros de 3 pies y medio por 2 y medio y se usaron vidrios cuyo diámetro tenía de 7 a 8 pulgadas, pero después crecieron las dimensiones de estos últimos hasta 10 o 12 pulgadas y las de aquellos hasta 6 pies y medio de longitud por 4 de altura. Ofrecía aquel cosmorama variedad al mismo tiempo que instrucción; se admitían abonos y no se exigía más que la mitad del precio a los niños, alumnos de los colegios y jóvenes artistas. \nA pesar de contribuir al fomento de las artes, dando ocupación a los artistas, llegó su época de decadencia y se cerró después de haber existido veinticinco años. Ha tenido muchos admiradores en varias capitales, desde entonces se inventaron una multitud de espectáculos parecidos con variedad de nombres, tales como: \n\npanstereorama (de pan, todo; stereos, todo y horama, vista), vista de planos en relieve\nalporama, vista de los Alpes\ndiafanorama, o vistas de cuadros trasparentes\npirorama, exposición en vidrio\ndiorama\nuranorama, o representación de los movimientos celestes\neuroporama, vistas de Europa\ngeorama, vista de todas las partes del mundo en una grande esfera\nneorama o vistas interiores de edificios\notros diferentes, sin contar con el panorama, que ya era conocido anteriormenteEl abate Gazzera, que puede ser considerado como fundador del cosmorama, regaló sus mejores cuadros a sus amigos, a la población de Mondovi, donde nació; a la de Velletri, donde tuvo una cátedra de teología, a la de Aviñón y a otras que le habían concedido hospitalidad en tiempos aciagos. Prefirió dejar una memoria honrosa con esos actos de generosidad, antes que ceder su colección a la familia real que se la pagaba mezquinamente.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,2]]},"citation-key":"CosmoramaPintura2021","container-title":"Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,30]]},"language":"es","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 139382710","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Cosmorama (pintura)","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cosmorama_(pintura)&oldid=139382710"},

Ranging across such topics as slavery, emancipation, scientific racism, immigration policies, racial classifications, and legal processes, Cottrol unravels a complex odyssey.

That system's legacy was later echoed in Jim Crow, the practice of legally mandated segregation. Jim Crow in turn caused leading Latin Americans to regard their nations as models of racial equality because their laws did not mandate racial discrimination- a belief that masked very real patterns of racism throughout the Americas. And yet, Cottrol says, if the United States has had a history of more-rigid racial exclusion, since the Second World War it has also had a more thorough civil rights revolution, with significant legal victories over racial discrimination.

The United States is usually and correctly seen as pursuing a monolithic, hegemonic agenda in Latin America, wielding political, economic, and military muscle to force Latin American countries to do its bidding, but the Crandalls reveal unexpected yet salient regional interactions where Latin Americans have exercised their own power with their northern and very powerful neighbor.

She outlines the tension between China's embrace of the free market and a regime dependent on a socialist imprimatur. She also offers a genealogy of China's transformation from a source of revolutionary power into a fountainhead of globalized modernity.

  {"id":"DakotaAccessPipeline2021","abstract":"The Dakota Access Pipeline protests, also called by the hashtag #NoDAPL, were grassroots movements that began in early 2016 in reaction to the approved construction of Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access Pipeline in the northern United States. The pipeline was projected to run from the Bakken oil fields in western North Dakota to southern Illinois, crossing beneath the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, as well as under part of Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.  Many in the Standing Rock tribe and surrounding communities consider the pipeline to constitute a serious threat to the region's water. The construction is also seen as a direct threat to ancient burial grounds and cultural sites of historic importance.\nIn April 2016, youth from Standing Rock and surrounding Native American communities organized a campaign to stop the pipeline, calling themselves, \"ReZpect Our Water\". Inspired by the youth, several adults, including Joye Braun of the Indigenous Environmental Network and tribal historian LaDonna Brave Bull Allard established a water protectors' camp as a center for direct action, spiritual resistance to the pipeline, cultural preservation, and defense of Indigenous sovereignty. The #NoDAPL hashtag began to trend on social media and, gradually, the camps at Standing Rock grew to thousands of people.In September 2016, construction workers bulldozed a section of privately owned land the tribe had claimed as sacred ground, and when protesters trespassed into the area security workers used attack dogs which bit at least six of the protesters and one horse.  In October 2016, police with riot gear and military equipment cleared an encampment that was directly in the proposed pipeline's path. In November 2016, police use of water cannons on protesters in freezing weather drew significant media attention.During the protest numerous high-profile activists and Congressional Democrats spoke out for the rights of the tribe. Bernie Sanders actively supported the movement  and President Obama spoke with tribal leaders and offered his support. Standing Rock Chairman David Archambault II, who was himself arrested and strip searched while protesting, gave numerous interviews explaining the tribe's positions; he also addressed the tribe's positions at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland.\nIn an October 28, 2016 public statement, Chief Arvol Looking Horse, spiritual leader and Keeper of the Sacred Pipe Bundle of the Lakota/Dakota/Nakota Nations, invoked his role as the voice of traditional government of the Great Sioux Nation and called upon President Barack Obama to communicate \"nation to nation, as indicated by our treaties.\"In December 2016, under President Barack Obama's administration the Corps of Engineers denied an easement for construction of the pipeline under the Missouri River. On January 24, 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that reversed the Obama legislation and advanced the construction of the pipeline, expediting the environmental review, which Trump described as an \"incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process.\"  On February 7, 2017, President Trump authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed, ending the environmental impact assessment and the associated public comment period. The pipeline was completed by April and its first oil was delivered on May 14, 2017.A United States District Judge ruled in March 2020 that the government had not studied the pipeline's \"effects on the quality of the human environment\" enough, ordering the United States Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a new environmental impact review. In July 2020, a District Court judge issued a ruling for the pipeline to be shut down and emptied of oil pending a new environmental review.  The temporary shutdown order was overturned by a U.S. appeals court on August 5, though the environmental review was ordered to continue.Journalists, such as Amy Goodman, political figures such as Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka, actress Shailene Woodley, and numerous members of the left-leaning media collective Unicorn Riot were arrested.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"citation-key":"DakotaAccessPipeline2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1017408088","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Dakota Access Pipeline protests","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dakota_Access_Pipeline_protests&oldid=1017408088"},

  {"id":"davisAnthropoceneCapitalocenePlantationocene2019","abstract":"The “Plantationocene” has gained traction in the environmental humanities as a way of conceptualizing the current era otherwise nominated as the Anthropocene, Capitalocene, or the Chthulucene. For Donna Haraway, Anna Tsing, and their interlocutors, the concept suggests that our current ecological crisis is rooted in logics of environmental modernization, homogeneity, and control, which were developed on historical plantations. This paper argues that, while there is indeed a need to analyze the ways in which the plantation past shapes the present, current discussions of the Plantationocene have several crucial limitations. Here, we focus on two: first, the current multispecies framing conceptualizes the plantation largely as a system of human control over nature, obscuring the centrality of racial politics; and second, the emerging Plantationocene discussion has yet to meaningfully engage with the wide variety of existing critiques of the plantation mode of development. Thus, we draw on a deep well of Black geographic and ecological work that provides a powerful challenge to the ongoing colonial–racial legacies of the plantation, prompting consideration of white supremacy, capitalist development, and (mis)characterizations of what it means to be human. These approaches not only reveal a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of the role of the plantation in current global crises but also highlight ongoing struggles and the possibilities of ecological justice in the future.","author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"Janae"},{"family":"Moulton","given":"Alex A."},{"family":"Van Sant","given":"Levi"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"davisAnthropoceneCapitalocenePlantationocene2019","container-title":"Geography Compass","DOI":"10.1111/gec3.12438","ISSN":"1749-8198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"n/a–n/a","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Anthropocene, Capitalocene, … Plantationocene?: A Manifesto for Ecological Justice in an Age of Global Crises","title-short":"Anthropocene, Capitalocene, … Plantationocene?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://web-p-ebscohost-com.proxy.library.nd.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=814961bf-0a37-49c6-85d9-1983867221fe%40redis&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN=136556189","volume":"13"},

Through a careful comparative analysis of nearly two hundred years of census taking, it demonstrates that changes in racial schemas are driven by the interactions among shifting transnational ideas about race, the ways they are tempered and translated by nationally distinct racial projects, and the configuration of political institutions involved in the design and execution of census policy. This book argues that states seek to make their populations racially legible, turning the fluid and politically contested substance of race into stable, identifiable categories to be used as the basis of law and policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,10]]},"author":[{"literal":"Debra Thompson [Debra E"}],"citation-key":"debrathompson[debraeSchematicStateRace2016","contributor":[{"literal":"Cambridge University Press"}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-1-316-44295-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"The Schematic State: Race, Transnationalism, and the Politics of the Census","title-short":"The Schematic State","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316442951"},

  {"id":"degiovanniVernacularLatinAmericanisms2018","abstract":"\"In Vernacular Latin Americanisms, Fernando Degiovanni offers a long-view perspective on the intense debates that shaped Latin American studies and still inform their function in the globalized and neoliberal university of today. By doing so he provides a reevaluation of a field whose epistemological and political status has obsessed its participants up until the present. The book focuses on the emergence of Latin Americanism as a field of critical debate and scholarly inquiry between the 1890s and the 1960s. Drawing on contemporary theory, intellectual history, and extensive archival research, Degiovanni explores in particular how the discourse and realities of war and capitalism have left an indelible mark on the formation of disciplinary perspectives on Latin American cultures in both the United States and Latin America. Questioning the premise that Latin Americanism as a discipline comes out of the tradition of continental identity developed by prominent intellectuals such as Jose Martí, Jose E. Rodó or Jose Vasconcelos, Degiovanni proposes that the scholars who established the discipline did not set out to defend Latin America as a place of uncontaminated spiritual values opposed to a utilitarian and materialist United States. Their mission was entirely different, even the opposite: giving a place to culture in the consolidation of alternative models of regional economic cooperation at moments of international armed conflict. For scholars theorizing Latin Americanism in market terms, this meant questioning nativist and cosmopolitan narratives about identity; it also meant abandoning any Bolivarian project of continental unity or of socialist internationalism\"--","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Degiovanni","given":"Fernando"}],"call-number":"F 1409.9 .D44 2018","citation-key":"degiovanniVernacularLatinAmericanisms2018","collection-title":"Illuminations : cultural formations of the Americas series","contributor":[{"literal":"Project Muse"}],"event-place":"Pittsburgh, Pa.","ISBN":"978-0-8229-8635-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of Pittsburgh Press","publisher-place":"Pittsburgh, Pa.","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Vernacular Latin Americanisms: War, the Market, and the Making of a Discipline","title-short":"Vernacular Latin Americanisms","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/63136/"},

The Gaceta refused to acknowledge Spanish Monarchical support for Caldas and the extensive network patriotically studying political economy and natural history for the Crown. Colombian officials deployed print culture to convince national audiences that monarchical tyranny and chaotic federalism sealed Caldas’ fate. They did so to secure Bogotá’s capital status and centralizing authority over cities resentful of Bogotá’s pretentions. Officials claimed Caldas inspired this call, erasing their appropriation of long-standing state-building traditions from Spain.

A esta pregunta responden las clases dictadas entre abril y mayo de 1986. La respuesta supondrá atravesar el universo común a Heidegger y a Blanchot, que gravita sobre las nociones de afuera y de pliegue, para desembocar en la solución original de Foucault a partir del gobierno de sí. Forzosamente habrá que pasar por los “misterios” del final de su obra: ¿por qué ese raro regreso a los griegos? ¿por qué el retorno al sujeto? Se terminará de bosquejar así el tercer gran eje de la obra foucaultiana: la subjetivación.

Despite increasing efforts to encourage data sharing, both the quality of shared data and the frequency of data reuse remain stubbornly low. We argue here that a significant reason for this unfortunate state of affairs is that the organization of research results in the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) form required for reuse is too often deferred to the end of a research project, when preparing for publication—by which time essential details are no longer accessible. Thus, we propose an approach to research informatics in which FAIR principles are applied continuously, from the inception of a research project, and ubiquitously, to every data asset produced by experiment or computation. We suggest that this seemingly challenging task can be made feasible by the adoption of simple tools, such as lightweight identifiers (to ensure that every data asset is findable), packaging methods (to facilitate understanding of data contents), data access methods, and metadata organization and structuring tools (to support schema development and evolution). We use an example from experimental neuroscience to illustrate how these methods can work in practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Dempsey","given":"William P."},{"family":"Foster","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Fraser","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Kesselman","given":"Carl"}],"citation-key":"dempseySharingBeginsHome2022","container-title":"Harvard Data Science Review","DOI":"10.1162/99608f92.44d21b86","ISSN":"2644-2353,","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,28]]},"language":"en","source":"hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu","title":"Sharing Begins at Home: How Continuous and Ubiquitous FAIRness Can Enhance Research Productivity and Data Reuse","title-short":"Sharing Begins at Home","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/qjpg8oik/release/2","volume":"4"},

On a beach in Santo Domingo, a doomed relationship flounders. In the heat of a hospital laundry room in New Jersey, a woman does her lover's washing and thinks about his wife. In Boston, a man buys his love child, his only son, a first baseball bat and glove. At the heart of these stories is the irrepressible, irresistible Yunior, a young hardhead whose longing for love is equaled only by his recklessness--and by the extraordinary women he loves and loses: artistic Alma; the aging Miss Lora; Magdalena, who thinks all Dominican men are cheaters; and the love of his life, whose heartbreak ultimately becomes his own. In prose that is endlessly energetic, inventive, tender, and funny, the stories in This is How You Lose Her lay bare the infinite longing and inevitable weakness of the human heart.

Design/methodology/approach Based on the Marxist theory of international value, the authors of this paper indicate that development benefit is the result of developing countries' consistently increasing labor productivity, reducing squandering in labor and transforming more labor into real value, and thus the fundamental cause of unequal development in international economics turns from the field of circulation to the area of production. Findings Also, the authors summarize China's experience of obtaining the development benefit and China's development path featuring common development and criticized the comparative advantage of mainstream Western economics, revealed the path of dependency development represented by mainstream Western economics.

  {"id":"District2023","abstract":"District 9 is a 2009 science fiction action film directed by Neill Blomkamp in his feature film debut, written by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, and produced by Peter Jackson and Carolynne Cunningham. It is a co-production of New Zealand, the United States, and South Africa. The film stars Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, and David James, and was adapted from Blomkamp's 2006 short film Alive in Joburg.\nThe film is partially presented in a found footage format by featuring fictional interviews, news footage, and video from surveillance cameras. The story, which explores themes of humanity, xenophobia and social segregation, begins in an alternate 1982, when an alien spaceship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. When a population of sick and malnourished insectoid aliens is discovered on the ship, the South African government confines them to an internment camp called District 9. Twenty years later, during the government's relocation of the aliens to another camp, one of the confined aliens named Christopher Johnson, who is about to try to escape from Earth with his son and return home, crosses paths with a bureaucrat named Wikus van de Merwe leading the relocation. The title and premise of District 9 were inspired by events in Cape Town's District Six, during the apartheid era.\nA viral marketing campaign for the film began in 2008 at San Diego Comic-Con, while the theatrical trailer debuted in July 2009. District 9 was released by TriStar Pictures on 14 August 2009, in North America and became a financial success, earning over $210 million at the box office. It also received acclaim from critics, with some calling it one of the best science fiction films of the 2000s, and garnered numerous awards and nominations, including four Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,7]]},"citation-key":"District2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,5]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1142993281","source":"Wikipedia","title":"<i>District 9</i>","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=District_9&oldid=1142993281"},

Este proyecto es pionero en el ámbito de los estudios prosódicos porque nace con el propósito de llenar un vacío en los estudios geolingüísticos utilizando idéntica metodología y protocolos y, además, porque plantea, por primera vez, difundir los resultados prosódicos por internet en forma de atlas interactivos. Esta monografía ilustra con algunos trabajos representativos los análisis, herramientas y avances de este proyecto desde perspectivas diferentes, entre otros, la entonación de las variedades ibéricas occidentales, las relaciones entre producción y percepción y el reconocimiento de la prosodia en distintas zonas de Asturias, la entonación canario-texana en un corpus de habla semiespontánea o la influencia del corpus de habla en la entonación de la región suroriental venezolana.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Dorta","given":"Josefa (ed )"}],"citation-key":"dortaInvestigacionGeoprosodica","language":"en","source":"www-digitaliapublishing-com.proxy.library.nd.edu","title":"Investigación geoprosódica","type":"book","URL":"https://www-digitaliapublishing-com.proxy.library.nd.edu/a/63049/investigacion-geoprosodica"},
  {"id":"douglasEndBooksBooks2001","abstract":"Of all developments surrounding hypermedia, none has been as hotly or frequently debated as the conjunction of fiction and digital technology. J. Yellowlees Douglas considers the implications of this union. She looks at the new light that interactive narratives may shed on theories of reading and interpretation and the possibilities for hypertext novels, World Wide Web-based short stories, and cinematic, interactive narratives on CD-ROM. She confronts questions that are at the center of the current debate: Does an interactive story demand too much from readers? Does the concept of readerly choice destroy the integrity of an author's vision? Does interactivity turn reading fiction from \"play\" into \"work\"--too much work? Will hypertext fiction overtake the novel as a form of art or entertainment? And what might future interactive books look like? The book examines criticism on interactive fiction from both proponents and skeptics and examines similarities and differences between print and hypertext fiction. It looks closely at critically acclaimed interactive works, including Stuart Moulthrop's Victory Garden and Michael Joyce's Afternoon: A Story that illuminate how these hypertext narratives \"work.\" While she sees this as a still-evolving technology and medium, the author identifies possible developments for the future of storytelling from outstanding examples of Web-based fiction and CD-ROM narratives, possibilities that will enable narratives to both portray the world with greater realism an to transcend the boundaries of novels and films, character and plot alike. Written to be accessible to a wide range of readers, this lively and accessibly-written volume will appeal to those interested in technology and cyberculture, as well as to readers familiar with literary criticism and modern fiction. J. Yellowlees Douglas is the Director of the William and Grace Dial Center for Written and Oral Communication, University of Florida. She is the author of numerous articles and essays on the subject of hypertext and interactive literature.","author":[{"family":"Douglas","given":"J.

  {"id":"douglassTheorisingCommercialSociety2018","abstract":"In his posthumously published lectures, Politics in Commercial Society, István Hont argues that Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith should be understood as theorists of commercial society. This article challenges Hont’s interpretation of both thinkers and shows that some of his key claims depend on conflating the terms ‘commercial society’ and ‘commercial sociability’. I argue that, for Smith, commercial society should not be defined in terms of the moral psychology of commercial sociability, before questioning Hont’s Epicurean interpretation of Smith’s theory of sociability. I then turn to Rousseau and outline some of the difficulties involved with classifying him as a theorist of commercial society, the most important of which is that he often appeared to be more deeply opposed to commercial progress than Hont suggests. I conclude by highlighting some of the most salient differences between Rousseau’s and Smith’s views of the politics of eighteenth-century Europe.","author":[{"family":"Douglass","given":"Robin"}],"citation-key":"douglassTheorisingCommercialSociety2018","container-title":"European Journal of Political Theory","contributor":[{"family":"Sagar","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Brooke","given":"Christopher"}],"DOI":"10.1177/1474885118782390","event-place":"London, England","ISSN":"1474-8851","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","page":"501–511","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher-place":"London, England","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Theorising commercial society: Rousseau, Smith and Hont","title-short":"Theorising commercial society","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},

Rosa and Enrique make their way north from Guatemala through Mexico, and to the United States. The film portrays the siblings on a journey, during which they hope “to make lots of money and return home.” The film La misma luna (Under the Same Moon, Patricia Riggen 2007) tells the story of Carlitos, a nine-year-old Mexican boy who travels to Los Angeles in search of his mother when his grandmother passes away. Along the way the characters from both films struggle with the loss of cultural identity, strain on family relationships, discrimination, and difficult working circumstances. Both Latino directors use structural elements that follow Joseph Campbell's outline of the hero's journey and incorporate magical or dream reality elements to remind the viewer of mythology. By positioning the immigrant as a hero on a “road of trials,” the filmmakers suggest that all immigrants are on their own hero's journey. These films give a heroic dimension to the many facing these struggles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Drake","given":"Susan Wiebe"}],"citation-key":"drakeHeroicJourneysImmigrant2013","container-title":"Studies in Latin American Popular Culture","container-title-short":"Studies in Latin American Popular Culture","DOI":"10.7560/SLAPC3106","ISSN":"0730-9139","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,2]]},"language":"English","page":"85-98","publisher":"University of Texas Press","source":"utexaspressjournals.org (Atypon)","title":"Heroic Journeys: The Immigrant Experience as the Hero's Journey in El Norte and La misma luna","title-short":"Heroic Journeys","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.utexaspressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7560/SLAPC3106"},

According to most academic papers written, there would be a political and intellectual identification between Bolívar and Rodríguez.

  {"id":"EmanuelSwedenborg2022","abstract":"Emanuel Swedenborg (, Swedish: [ˈsvêːdɛnˌbɔrj] (listen); born Emanuel Swedberg; 8 February [O.S. 29 January] 1688 – 29 March 1772) was a Swedish pluralistic-Christian theologian, scientist, philosopher and mystic. He became best known for his book on the afterlife, Heaven and Hell (1758).Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. In 1741, at 53, he entered into a spiritual phase in which he began to experience dreams and visions, notably on Easter Weekend, on 6 April\n1744.\nHis experiences culminated in a \"spiritual awakening\" in which he received a revelation that Jesus Christ had appointed him to write The Heavenly Doctrine to reform Christianity. According to The Heavenly Doctrine, the Lord had opened Swedenborg's spiritual eyes so that from then on, he could freely visit heaven and hell to converse with angels, demons and other spirits, and that the Last Judgment had already occurred in 1757, the year before the 1758 publication of De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus doctrina coelesti (English: Concerning the New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine).Over the last 28 years of his life, Swedenborg wrote 18 published theological works—and several more that remained unpublished. He termed himself a \"Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ\" in True Christian Religion, which he published himself. Some followers of The Heavenly Doctrine believe that of his theological works, only those that were published by Swedenborg himself are fully divinely inspired. Others have regarded all Swedenborg's theological works as equally inspired, saying for example that the fact that some works were \"not written out in a final edited form for publication does not make a single statement less trustworthy than the statements in any of the other works\". The New Church, also known as Swedenborgianism, is a new religious movement originally founded in 1787 and comprising several historically related Christian denominations that revere Swedenborg's writings as revelation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,10]]},"citation-key":"EmanuelSwedenborg2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,6]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1120354106","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Emanuel Swedenborg","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emanuel_Swedenborg&oldid=1120354106#cite_note-151"},

Less explored, however, is the way in which the South interacts with this received wisdom. This article explicitly focuses on how Venezuela, as one of the more outspoken southern states, works within and subverts the dominant U.S.-authored tropes in Latin America. It suggests that while U.S. representations of the Cha´vez administration as a strange anomaly in the America’s resonate in Venezuela and beyond, it is possible for Venezuela to subvert these messages by ‘‘embracing strangeness.’’ That is, by embracing and expanding the difference attributed to them onto the rest of Latin America, Venezuela is able to use ‘‘strangeness’’ to open up possibilities for new meanings and political spaces in the Americas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Emerson","given":"R.

I reveal that Benjamin has encoded a ladder in his essay through his seemingly fragmentary ruminations or 'philosophical observations'. I attempt a genealogy of 'The Storyteller', where I recognize that the ladder is an inspiration from Jewish mystical tradition, the Kabbala, where the cycle of life is realized and interpreted. I trace this ladder of experience through my own fieldwork on Persian carpets where I argue the importance of carpet weaving for the art of storytelling and vice versa, and in turn its implications and possibilities for recounting ethnographic accounts. By examining Benjamin's writing on the craft of the artisan and his concept of experience, I explore the significance of storytelling as an ethnographic and experiential art.

  {"id":"EuropeanMiracle2020","abstract":"The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia is a book written by Eric Jones in 1981 to refer to the sudden rise of Europe during the late Middle Ages. Ahead of the Islamic and Chinese civilizations, Europe steadily rose since the Early Modern period to a complete domination of  world trade and politics that remained unchallenged until the early 20th century.\nThis process started with the first European contacts and subsequent colonization of great expanses of the world. The industrial revolution further reinforced it.\nJones's book gave rise to the term European miracle. It is closely related to the idea of the Great divergence, which rather than on the origins of the rise of Europe during the Renaissance focuses on the culmination of the process in the 18th century and the subsequent \"imperial century\" of Britain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"citation-key":"EuropeanMiracle2020","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,28]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 996758590","source":"Wikipedia","title":"<i>The European Miracle</i>","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_European_Miracle&oldid=996758590"},

  {"id":"ExpresionAmericana2021","abstract":"La expresión americana es un libro de ensayos del escritor cubano José Lezama Lima, publicado en 1957. Se trata quizás de su obra más estructurada y sistemática,[1]​  ya que a diferencia del resto de sus volúmenes ensayísticos, que recogen textos publicados previamente en diferentes medios, está compuesta por cinco conferencias que dictó en el Palacio de Bellas Artes de\nLa Habana los días 16, 18, 22, 23 y 26 de enero de ese año, en un ciclo organizado por el Instituto Nacional de Cultura.[2]​[3]​ \nEn una línea similar a la de autores como José Enrique Rodó, Alfonso Reyes, Fernando Ortiz, Arturo Uslar Pietri, Alejo Carpentier o Pedro Henriquez Ureña, pero con una intención mucho más totalizadora, Lezama aborda en estas conferencias la problemática de la identidad y el ser americano desde su visión de la historia a través de la poesía y la imagen. Esta sería, según Irlemar Chiampi, la primera vez que Lezama pone a prueba la aplicabilidad de estos conceptos a la historia cultural americana.[4]​ \nEs importante aclarar que Lezama no sigue una visión racional y objetiva de la historia, de tipo hegeliana, si bien toma ciertos aspectos de ella. En primer lugar, mientras que Hegel piensa a la naturaleza y al paisaje como un elemento inerte y ahistórico, Lezama le otorga un papel fundamental en el decurso histórico y la conformación del ser americano; en segundo lugar, mientras que la racionalidad hegeliana implica un deber ser inevitable e irrenunciable, la visión poética de Lezama (basada en el contrapunto) permite señalar la imago, el potens, es decir, la infinita posibilidad del poder ser.[4]​ A través de una reinterpretación poética de la historia americana, Lezama no busca llegar a una identidad constitutiva absoluta, sino que le interesa rastrear «la forma en devenir en que un paisaje va hacia un sentido, una interpretación o una sencilla hermenéutica, para ir después hacia su reconstrucción, que es en forma definitiva lo que marca su eficacia o desuso, su fuerza ordenancista o su apagado eco, que es su visión histórica».[5]​","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,19]]},"citation-key":"ExpresionAmericana2021","container-title":"Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,28]]},"language":"es","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 139352903","source":"Wikipedia","title":"La expresión americana","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=La_expresi%C3%B3n_americana&oldid=139352903"},

However, there is a resurgent interest in alternative ontologies from panpsychism (the view that at the base of reality exists potential minds, minds, or mind-lets) to idealism and dualism (the view that all of reality is material and mental). The Routledge Handbook of Idealism and Immaterialism is an outstanding reference source and the first major collection of its kind. Historically grounded and constructively motivated, it covers the key topics in philosophy, science, and theology, providing students and scholars with a comprehensive introduction to idealism and immaterialism. Also addressed is post-materialism developments, with explicit attention to variations of idealism and immaterialism (the view that reality depends on a mind or a set of minds). Comprising forty-four chapters written by an international and interdisciplinary team of contributors, the Handbook is organised into five clear parts: Idealism and the History of Philosophy Important Figures in Idealism Systematic Assessment of Idealism and Science Idealism, Physicalism, Panpsychism, and Substance Dualism.

  {"id":"fielbaumEspirituSinBarro2022","abstract":"The paper reads some discussions and a poem written by Andrés Bello in the context of the hostility towards materialist ideas that can be read in the first half of the nineteenth century in Latin America. To this purpose, it begins by presenting some general notions about the materialist critique of religion and authority. Subsequently, it explains the impossibility of the development of a certain “radical Enlightenment” in the framework of the Latin American society of that time. Bello’s criticism of materialism is then presented, particularly in relation to the work of Lucretius, which he presents by translating and transforming a text by Abel-François Villemain with which Bello seeks to separate Lucretius from any form of literature. This explains why Lucretius is quoted in the founding speech of the University of Chile to explain what literature should not be. Poetry for Bello must be antimaterialist, as in the poem in which he revisits the materialist topic of the fall to support the need for a spiritual direction of the body and the people. Finally, we highlight the importance that the revision of materialism can have for a critique of the past and present of an authoritarian democracy in the continent.","author":[{"family":"Fielbaum","given":"Alejandro"}],"citation-key":"fielbaumEspirituSinBarro2022","container-title":"MERIDIONAL Revista Chilena de Estudios Latinoamericanos","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"es","source":"Zotero","title":"Un espíritu sin barro.

Although Palés’s poems do not explicitly address environmental concerns, they actively respond to colonial forms of capitalist developmentalism that shaped the Caribbean during the first half of the twentieth century. Palés offers a critical portrayal of a “natural” landscape dominated by multinational economic interests and by unsustainable models of tourism. In contrast, in some of his poems Palés offers a more ecological vision of nature anchored in the realm of Afro-Caribbean spiritual belief systems. However, Palés does not present an idealized view of nature—his ironic perspective remains ambivalent between a critique of a capitalist modernity in which nature is simply an exploitable resource, and a sacred vision to which modernity, including the poet himself, no longer has access.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Figueroa","given":"Víctor"}],"citation-key":"figueroaColonialCommodityNuminous2017","container-title":"Hispanic review","DOI":"10.1353/hir.2017.0022","event-place":"PHILADELPHIA","ISSN":"0018-2176","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","page":"245–269","publisher":"University of Pennsylvania Press","publisher-place":"PHILADELPHIA","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Colonial Commodity or Numinous Realm?

The emergence of a 21st century sonic hauntology is a sign that “white” culture can no longer escape the temporal disjunctions that have been constitutive of the Afrodiasporic experience since Africans were first abducted by slavers and projected from their own lifeworld into the abstract space-time of Capital.

Under the guidance of series editor Arnold I. Davidson, Picador will publish all thirteen volumes of the lectures in North America.\" \"In \"Society Must Be Defended,\" the inaugural volume in the series, translated by David Macey, Foucault traces the genealogy of the problem of war in society from the seventeenth century to the present. Inverting Clausewitz's famous formulation - \"War is politics by other means,\" Foucault explores the notion that \"politics is war by other means\" in its relation to race, class struggle, and, of course, power. Providing us with a new model of political rationality, he overturns many of our long-held ideas of sovereignty, the law, and even truth itself. The full significance of the dictum \"Society must be defended\" becomes clear when Foucault's examination culminates in an extraordinary discussion of modern forms of racism.\"--Jacket.","author":[{"family":"Foucault","given":"Michel","suffix":""}],"citation-key":"foucaultSocietyMustBe2003","editor":[{"family":"Bertani","given":"Mauro","suffix":""},{"family":"Fontana","given":"Alessandro","suffix":""},{"family":"Ewald","given":"François","suffix":""}],"ISBN":"0-312-20318-7 0-312-42266-0 978-0-312-42266-0 978-0-312-20318-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Picador","source":"http://worldcat.org","title":"\"Society must be defended\" : lectures at the Collège de France, 1975-76","translator":[{"family":"Macey","given":"David","suffix":""}],"type":"book"},

  {"id":"FranzBoas2021","abstract":"Franz Uri Boas (July 9, 1858 – December 21, 1942) was a German-born American anthropologist and a pioneer of modern anthropology who has been called the \"Father of American Anthropology\". His work is associated with the movements known as Historical Particularism and Cultural Relativism.Studying in Germany, Boas was awarded a doctorate in 1881 in physics while also studying geography. He then participated in a geographical expedition to northern Canada, where he became fascinated with the culture and language of the Baffin Island Inuit. He went on to do field work with the indigenous cultures and languages of the Pacific Northwest. In 1887 he emigrated to the United States, where he first worked as a museum curator at the Smithsonian, and in 1899 became a professor of anthropology at Columbia University, where he remained for the rest of his career. Through his students, many of whom went on to found anthropology departments and research programmes inspired by their mentor, Boas profoundly influenced the development of American anthropology. Among his most significant students were A. L. Kroeber, Ruth Benedict, Edward Sapir, Margaret Mead, Zora Neale Hurston, Gilberto Freyre and many others.Boas was one of the most prominent opponents of the then-popular ideologies of scientific racism, the idea that race is a biological concept and that human behavior is best understood through the typology of biological characteristics. In a series of groundbreaking studies of skeletal anatomy he showed that cranial shape and size was highly malleable depending on environmental factors such as health and nutrition, in contrast to the claims by racial anthropologists of the day that held head shape to be a stable racial trait. Boas also worked to demonstrate that differences in human behavior are not primarily determined by innate biological dispositions but are largely the result of cultural differences acquired through social learning. In this way, Boas introduced culture as the primary concept for describing differences in behavior between human groups, and as the central analytical concept of anthropology.Among Boas's main contributions to anthropological thought was his rejection of the then-popular evolutionary approaches to the study of culture, which saw all societies progressing through a set of hierarchic technological and cultural stages, with Western European culture at the summit. Boas argued that culture developed historically through the interactions of groups of people and the diffusion of ideas and that consequently there was no process towards continuously \"higher\" cultural forms. This insight led Boas to reject the \"stage\"-based organization of ethnological museums, instead preferring to order items on display based on the affinity and proximity of the cultural groups in question.\nBoas also introduced the idea of cultural relativism, which holds that cultures cannot be objectively ranked as higher or lower, or better or more correct, but that all humans see the world through the lens of their own culture, and judge it according to their own culturally acquired norms. For Boas, the object of anthropology was to understand the way in which culture conditioned people to understand and interact with the world in different ways and to do this it was necessary to gain an understanding of the language and cultural practices of the people studied. By uniting the disciplines of archaeology, the study of material culture and history, and physical anthropology, the study of variation in human anatomy, with ethnology, the study of cultural variation of customs, and descriptive linguistics, the study of unwritten indigenous languages, Boas created the four-field subdivision of anthropology which became prominent in American anthropology in the 20th century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"citation-key":"FranzBoas2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1018717601","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Franz Boas","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Franz_Boas&oldid=1018717601"},

  {"id":"FugitiveSlaveLaws2021","abstract":"The fugitive slave laws were laws passed by the United States Congress in 1793 and 1850 to provide for the return of enslaved people who escaped from one state into another state or territory. The idea of the fugitive slave law was derived from the Fugitive Slave Clause which is in the United States Constitution (Article IV, Section 2, Paragraph 3). It was thought that forcing states to deliver freedom seekers back to enslavement violated states' rights due to state sovereignty and was believed that seizing state property should not be left up to the states. The Fugitive Slave Clause states that freedom seekers \"shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due\", which abridged state rights because forcing people back into enslavement was a form of retrieving private property. The Compromise of 1850 entailed a series of laws that allowed enslavement in the new territories and forced officials in free states to give a hearing to slave-owners who enslaved people without a jury.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"citation-key":"FugitiveSlaveLaws2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,16]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1000724803","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Fugitive slave laws in the United States","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fugitive_slave_laws_in_the_United_States&oldid=1000724803"},

  {"id":"gonzalez-ruibalAnthropoceneDefiningAge2018","abstract":"The question of the Anthropocene has gained increased notoriety among archaeologists recently. Precisely because of that, it is in need of thorough critique. The aim of this article is not to rule out the concept of Anthropocene, but to point out some of its problems: the relationship of Anthropocenic discourses with the emergence of an all-embracing biopolitical science; the inadequacies of the term, which blames all humans equally for a specific effect of modernity and capitalism; its failure to accept a diversity of origins (but also the problem of accepting overly deep origins), and the shortcomings of adopting a geological framework for archaeology. I thus suggest that the discipline has to define its own eras - also for the contemporary period - and that the Age of Destruction could be an apt archaeological counterpart for the Anthropocene. One of the benefits of outlining an archaeological era is that it brings modernity and capitalism back to the fore, and with them issues of power and conflict that have been largely lost in recent post-anthropocentric debates.","author":[{"family":"González-Ruibal","given":"Alfredo"}],"citation-key":"gonzalez-ruibalAnthropoceneDefiningAge2018","container-title":"Norwegian archaeological review","DOI":"10.1080/00293652.2018.1544169","ISSN":"0029-3652","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","page":"10–21","publisher":"Routledge","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Beyond the Anthropocene: Defining the Age of Destruction","title-short":"Beyond the Anthropocene","type":"article-journal","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"graeberDawnEverythingNew2021","abstract":"A trailblazing account of human history, challenging our most fundamental assumptions about social evolution--from the development of agriculture and cities to the emergence of \"the state,\" political violence, and social inequality--and revealing new possibilities for human emancipation. For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike--either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself. Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what's really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? What was really happening during the periods that we usually describe as the emergence of \"the state\"? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume. The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.

  {"id":"grandinEndMythFrontier2020","abstract":"Ever since this nation's founding, the idea of an open and ever-expanding frontier has been central to American identity. Symbolizing a future of endless promise, the frontier made possible the United States' belief in itself as an exceptional nation -- democratic, individualistic, forward-looking. Today, though, the country has a new symbol: the border wall. In this book, historian Greg Grandin explores the effect that constant, relentless expansion had on America's domestic politics, examining the full sweep of U.S. history -- from the American Revolution to the Spanish-American War, the New Deal to the election of 2016. For centuries, he shows, the ability to move outward -- fighting wars and opening markets -- provided America with a \"gate of escape,\" helping to deflect domestic political and economic conflicts. But this deflection meant that the country's problems, from racism to inequality, were never confronted directly. And now, the combined catastrophes of the 2008 financial meltdown, our unwinnable wars in the Middle East, and a deepening ecological crisis have slammed this gate shut, bringing political passions that had long been directed elsewhere back home. It is this new reality, Grandin says, that explains the rise of reactionary populism and racist nationalism, the extreme anger and polarization that catapulted Trump to the presidency. The border wall may or may not be built, but it will survive as a rallying point, an allegorical tombstone marking the end of American exceptionalism.","author":[{"family":"Grandin","given":"Greg","suffix":""}],"citation-key":"grandinEndMythFrontier2020","ISBN":"1-250-21485-8 978-1-250-21485-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Metropolitan Books","source":"http://worldcat.org","title":"The end of the myth : from the frontier to the border wall in the mind of America","type":"book"},

  {"id":"GreatDivergence2021","abstract":"The Great Divergence or European miracle is the socioeconomic shift in which the Western world (i.e. Western Europe and the parts of the New World where its people became the dominant populations) overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization, eclipsing Mughal India, Qing China, the Islamic world, the kingdoms and empires of Africa, and Tokugawa Japan.\nScholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including geography, culture, institutions, colonialism, resources and just pure chance. There is disagreement over the nomenclature of the \"great\" divergence, as a clear point of beginning of a divergence is traditionally held to be the 16th or even the 15th century, with the commercial revolution and the origins of mercantilism and capitalism during the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery, the rise of the European colonial empires, proto-globalization, the Scientific Revolution, or the Age of Enlightenment. Yet the largest jump in the divergence happened in the 19th century with the Industrial Revolution and Technological Revolution. For this reason, the \"California school\" considers only this to be the great divergence.Technological advances, in areas such as railroads, steamboats, mining, and agriculture, were embraced to a higher degree in the West than the East during the Great Divergence. Technology led to increased industrialization and economic complexity in the areas of agriculture, trade, fuel and resources, further separating the East and the West. Western Europe's use of coal as an energy substitute for wood in the mid-19th century gave it a major head start in modern energy production. In the twentieth century, the Great Divergence peaked before the First World War and continued until the early 1970s; then, after two decades of indeterminate fluctuations, in the late 1980s it was replaced by the Great Convergence as the majority of Third World countries reached economic growth rates significantly higher than those in most First World countries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"citation-key":"GreatDivergence2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,19]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1012946276","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Great Divergence","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Divergence&oldid=1012946276"},

  {"id":"guiNationalConsciousnessLiterary2013","abstract":"National Consciousness and Literary Cosmopolitics: Postcolonial Literature in a Global Moment by Weihsin Gui argues that postcolonial literature written within a framework of globalization still takes nationalism seriously rather than dismissing it as obsolete. Authors and texts often regarded as cosmopolitan, diasporic, or migrant actually challenge globalization’s tendency to treat nations as absolute and homogenous sociocultural entities.\n\nWhile social scientific theories of globalization after 1945 represent nationalism as antithetical to transnational economic and cultural flows, National Consciousness and Literary Cosmopolitics contends that postcolonial literature represents nationalism as a form of cosmopolitical engagement with what lies beyond the nation’s borders. Postcolonial literature never gave up on anticolonial nationalism but rather revised its meaning, extending the idea of the nation beyond an identity position into an interrogation of globalization and the neocolonial state through political consciousness and cultural critique.\n\nThe literary cosmopolitics evident in the works of Kazuo Ishiguro, Derek Walcott, Shirley Geok-lin Lim, Preeta Samarasan, and Twan Eng Tan distinguish between an instrumental national identity and a critical nationality that negates the subordination of nationalism by neocolonial regimes and global capitalism. Through their formal innovations, these writers represent nationalism not as a monolithic or essentialized identity or body of people but as a cosmopolitical constellation of political, social, and cultural forces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gui","given":"Weihsin"}],"citation-key":"guiNationalConsciousnessLiterary2013","event-place":"Columbus","ISBN":"978-0-8142-7110-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"publisher":"The Ohio State University Press","publisher-place":"Columbus","source":"Project MUSE","title":"National Consciousness and Literary Cosmopolitics: Postcolonial Literature in a Global Moment","title-short":"National Consciousness and Literary Cosmopolitics","type":"book","URL":"http://muse.jhu.edu/book/27542"},

  {"id":"GutenbergGalaxy2021","abstract":"The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man is a 1962 book by Marshall McLuhan, in which the author analyzes the effects of mass media, especially the printing press, on European culture and human consciousness. It popularized the term global village, which refers to the idea that mass communication allows a village-like mindset to apply to the entire world; and Gutenberg Galaxy, which we may regard today to refer to the accumulated body of recorded works of human art and knowledge, especially books.\nMcLuhan studies the emergence of what he calls Gutenberg Man, the subject produced by the change of consciousness wrought by the advent of the printed book. Apropos of his axiom, \"The medium is the message,\" McLuhan argues that technologies are not simply inventions which people employ but are the means by which people are re-invented. The invention of movable type was the decisive moment in the change from a culture in which all the senses partook of a common interplay to a tyranny of the visual. He also argued that the development of the printing press led to the creation of nationalism, dualism, domination of rationalism, automatisation of scientific research, uniformation and standardisation of culture and alienation of individuals.\nMovable type, with its ability to reproduce texts accurately and swiftly, extended the drive toward homogeneity and repeatability already in evidence in the emergence of perspectival art and the exigencies of the single \"point of view\". He writes:\n\nthe world of visual perspective is one of unified and homogeneous space. Such a world is alien to the resonating diversity of spoken words. So language was the last art to accept the visual logic of Gutenberg technology, and the first to rebound in the electric age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,27]]},"citation-key":"GutenbergGalaxy2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,9]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1005816807","source":"Wikipedia","title":"<i>The Gutenberg Galaxy</i>","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Gutenberg_Galaxy&oldid=1005816807"},

  {"id":"hanleyEnlightenedNationBuilding2008","abstract":"Rousseau is famous as an advocate of the politics of \"denaturing.\" But attention to his conception of the \"science of the legislator,\" as developed in the Geneva Manuscript and his writings on Poland and Corsica, reveals a more moderate approach to statecraft. Here Rousseau claims that legislative science requires tempering commitment to principles of political right with sensitivity to actual political conditions-a claim that importantly and unexpectedly parallels the better known account of the science of the legislator developed by Adam Smith. In comparing these conceptions, this article draws three conclusions: first, Smith's and Rousseau's shared moderation reveals their common commitment to accommodating the passions and prejudices of modernity; second, their fundamental difference concerns not practical legislative methods but rather differing conceptions of natural justice and political right; and finally, their prudential approach to legislation helps clarify the specific types of \"moderation\" and \"intelligence\" required of contemporary nation builders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Hanley","given":"Ryan Patrick"}],"citation-key":"hanleyEnlightenedNationBuilding2008","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","ISSN":"0092-5853","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"page":"219-234","publisher":"[Midwest Political Science Association, Wiley]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Enlightened Nation Building: The \"Science of the Legislator\" in Adam Smith and Rousseau","title-short":"Enlightened Nation Building","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25193810","volume":"52"},

Professor Harris traces the origins of whiteness as property in the parallel systems of domination of Black and Native American peoples out of which were created racially contingent forms of property and property rights.

  {"id":"healyMarxDigitalMachines2020","abstract":"This book explores the fundamental contradiction at the heart of the digital environment: technology offers all manner of promises, yet habitually fails to deliver. This failure often arises from numerous problems: the proficiency of the technology or end-user, policy failure at various levels, or a combination of these. Solutions such as better technology and more effective end-user education are often put into place to solve these failures. Mike Healy argues that such approaches are inherently faulty drawing upon qualitative research informed by Marx’s theory of alienation. Using Marx’s theory, he considers participants in three distinct settings: the workplace of information and communications technology (ICT) professionals; university scholars researching the ethical and societal implications of our digital environment; and a group of pensioners living in South London, UK, undertaking ICT training. By delving beneath the surface of how digital technologies are created, researched and experienced, this study illustrates the contradictory nature of our digital lives, as they directly arise from the needs of capitalism. The book also places Marx’s theory in contrast to the mainstream approaches derived from Seaman and Blauner. In researching and comprehending ICT, this book reaffirms the superior explanatory power of Marx’s theory of alienation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Healy","given":"Mike"}],"citation-key":"healyMarxDigitalMachines2020","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv199tdf0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"University of Westminster Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Marx and Digital Machines: Alienation, Technology, Capitalism","title-short":"Marx and Digital Machines","type":"book","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv199tdf0"},

It shows that even in Peru, Bolívar's main concern was to prevent the racial war and social disintegration that allegedly slaves and free Afro-descended people would bring to the newly independent nations. To prevent such an outcome, he advocated all along legal equality through the abolition of the colonial privileges and, since mid-1816, the abolition of slavery, but simultaneously the preservation of the monopole of power by the white creole elite. He secured the perpetuation of the socioracial hierarchy inherited from Spain by a two-edged citizenship: an active citizenship restricted to a tiny literate and skilled minority and an inactive citizenship for the immense majority of (mostly nonwhite) men.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Helg","given":"Aline"}],"citation-key":"helgSimonBolivarRepublic2012","container-title":"Revista de Sociologia e Política","container-title-short":"Rev.

  {"id":"helgSimonBolivarSpectre2003","abstract":"This article examines the tensions between the Gran Colombian republican constitution of 1821 and Simón Bolívar's fear of a mulatto takeover. It focuses on Cartagena in the 1820s, where the mulatto general José Padilla challenged the socio-racial hierarchy and accepted notions of equality of the city, heading a three-day coup in 1828 against Bolívar's attempt to impose a new authoritarian constitution. Padilla failed to rally the mostly African-derived population of Cartagena behind the republican views of Francisco de Paula Santander and was promptly executed. Using the protagonists' correspondence, manifestos, criminal investigations, consular reports and censuses, the article analyses the factors in the city's demography, political leadership and culture, and in the composition of its military forces, that explain Padilla's failure. It highlights the role played by race and by Bolívar's views of mulattos in the process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Helg","given":"Aline"}],"citation-key":"helgSimonBolivarSpectre2003","container-title":"Journal of Latin American Studies","DOI":"10.1017/S0022216X03006849","ISSN":"1469-767X, 0022-216X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,8]]},"language":"en","page":"447-471","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Simón Bolívar and the Spectre of Pardocracia: José Padilla in Post-Independence Cartagena","title-short":"Simón Bolívar and the Spectre of Pardocracia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-latin-american-studies/article/simon-bolivar-and-the-spectre-of-pardocracia-jose-padilla-in-postindependence-cartagena/7780B5FC9D2E8B475AFF6A4B9646D17D","volume":"35"},

The central empirical theme is the role of Indian structural power that was derived from Indian cotton textile exports. Indian structural power organised the first (historical-capitalist) global economy between 1500 and c.1850 and performed a vital, albeit indirect, role in the making of Western empire, industrialisation and the second (modern-capitalist) global economy.

  {"id":"holleyRousseauReceptionEpicurean2019","abstract":"What did Rousseau's readers mean when they called him an ‘Epicurean’? A seemingly simple question with complex implications. This article attempts to answer it by reconstructing Rousseau's contemporary reception as an Epicurean thinker. First, it surveys the earliest and most widely read critics of the second Discourse: Prussian Astronomer Royal Jean de Castillon, Jesuit priest Louis Bertrand Castel, and Hanoverian biblical scholar Hermann Samuel Reimarus. These readers branded Rousseau an Epicurean primarily to highlight his atheism, his anti-providential and materialist natural philosophy. Then, it discusses Genevan pastor Jacob Vernet's positive assessment of Rousseau as a critic of ‘fashionable’ Epicureanism, before reconstructing Rousseau's critique of the reception of Alexander Pope's Essay on Man as an Epicurean text. These sources elucidate Rousseau's engagement with a range of ideas and argumentative positions that would inform his later self-identification as a ‘refined’ Epicurean. In particular, they highlight his interest in how a sentimental awareness of beauty might mitigate the potentially vicious effects of hedonism. The article concludes with novelist Mme. de Genlis’ critique of Rousseau's Wise Materialism, using his thoughts on the imagination to suggest some of the ways the neglected aesthetic dimensions of Rousseau's reception of Epicureanism might be developed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Holley","given":"Jared"}],"citation-key":"holleyRousseauReceptionEpicurean2019","container-title":"History of European Ideas","DOI":"10.1080/01916599.2018.1563965","ISSN":"0191-6599","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,19]]},"page":"553-571","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Rousseau’s reception as an Epicurean: from atheism to aesthetics","title-short":"Rousseau’s reception as an Epicurean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01916599.2018.1563965","volume":"45"},
  {"id":"holleyRousseauRefinedEpicureanism2018","abstract":"This article argues that in order to understand the form of modern political freedom envisioned by Rousseau, we have to understand his theory of taste as refined Epicureanism. Rousseau saw the division of labour and corrupt taste as the greatest threats to modern freedom. He identified their cause in the spread of vulgar Epicureanism – the frenzied pursuit of money, vanity and sexual gratification. In its place, he advocated what he called ‘the Epicureanism of reason’, or refined Epicureanism. Materially grounded on an equitable proportion of needs and faculties, this was a hedonist theory of self-command designed to cultivate the temperate enjoyment of sensual pleasure. I argue that Rousseau hoped that a shift from vulgar to refined Epicureanism would secure political freedom in modernity by grounding the politics of the general will in an economics of balanced growth and a reinvigorated appreciation of natural beauty. This perspective provides a new way of both clarifying the role of economic justice and aesthetic judgment in Rousseau's republican state theory, and of assessing the consistency of his moral and political thought.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Holley","given":"Jared"}],"citation-key":"holleyRousseauRefinedEpicureanism2018","container-title":"European Journal of Political Theory","container-title-short":"European Journal of Political Theory","DOI":"10.1177/1474885118788963","ISSN":"1474-8851","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"411-431","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Rousseau on refined Epicureanism and the problem of modern liberty","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1474885118788963","volume":"17"},

Yet the conception that there is only one-originally Greek-type of techne has been an obstacle to any original critical thinking of technology in modern Chinese thought. This book argues for the urgency of imagining a specifically Chinese philosophy of technology capable of responding to Heidegger's conception and problematizing the affirmation of technics and technologies as anthropologically universal. Yuk Hui's systematic historical survey of Chinese thought in comparison to the antique philosophy in Europe explains why there is no systematic thinking of technics in Chinese thought. His subsequent investigation of the historical-metaphysical questions of modern technology, drawing on Lyotard, Simondon, and Stiegler, then sheds new light on the obscurity of the question of technology in China. Why has time never been a real question for Chinese philosophy, how has the category of Qi transformed in its relation to Dao in Chinese metaphysical discourse, and how might Chinese thought contribute to a renewed questioning of globalized technics?\"--Publisher description","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Hui","given":"Yuk"}],"call-number":"T 14 .H85 2016eb, T 14 .H85 2016","citation-key":"huiQuestionConcerningTechnology2016","collection-number":"003","collection-title":"Mono","contributor":[{"literal":"EBSCO Publishing"}],"event-place":"Falmouth, United Kingdom","ISBN":"978-1-913029-37-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"eng;chi","publisher":"Urbanomic Media Ltd","publisher-place":"Falmouth, United Kingdom","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"The question concerning technology in China: an essay in cosmotechnics","title-short":"The question concerning technology in China","type":"book","URL":"https://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=2007050"},

  {"id":"inceAdamSmithSettler2017","abstract":"Adam Smith has recently been celebrated as a precocious theorist of commercial cosmopolitanism who decried the injustice of imperial conquest and extraction. This paper focuses on Smith’s endorsement of settler colonialism in North America and argues that Smith’s newfound cosmopolitanism is overstretched. Smith welcomed settler colonies as the embodiment of the “natural progress of opulence” and spared them from his invective against other imperial practices like chattel slavery and trade monopolies. Smith’s embrace of settler colonies, however, involved him in an ideological conundrum insofar as the prosperity of overseas settlements rested on imperial expansion and seizure of land from Native Americans. I contend that Smith muffled this disturbing link through a number of rhetorical strategies, evoking a vision of colonization without imperialism. Smith’s favorable treatment of settler colonialism, I conclude, belongs to a longer genealogy of representing capitalism as an essentially liberal economic system in the face of its decidedly illiberal history. Investigating this genealogy necessitates breaking with the currently dominant conventions of studying the history of political thought and placing intellectual history in conversation with social theory and political economy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ince","given":"Onur Ulas"}],"citation-key":"inceAdamSmithSettler2017","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2971322","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,19]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 2971322","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Adam Smith, Settler Colonialism, and Cosmopolitan Overstretch","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2971322"},

  {"id":"inceCommerceEmpireDavid2017","abstract":"Eighteenth-century Enlightenment thought has recently been reclaimed as a robust, albeit short-lived, cosmopolitan critique of European imperialism. This essay complicates this interpretation through a study of David Hume’s reflections on commerce, empire, and slavery. I argue that while Hume condemned the colonial system of monopoly, war, and conquest, his strictures against empire did not extend to colonial slavery in the Atlantic. This was because colonial slavery represented a manifestly uncivil institution when judged by enlightened metropolitan sensibilities, yet also a decisively commercial institution pivotal to the eighteenth-century global economy. Confronted by the paradoxical “commercial incivility” of modern slavery, Hume opted for disavowing the link between slavery and commerce, and confined his criticism of slavery to its ancient, feudal, and Asiatic incarnations. I contend that Hume’s disavowal of the commercial barbarism of the Atlantic economy is part of a broader ideological effort to separate the idea of commerce from its imperial origins and posit it as the liberal antithesis of empire. The implications of analysis, I conclude, go beyond the eighteenth-century debates over commerce and empire, and more generally pertain to the contradictory entwinement of liberalism and capitalism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ince","given":"Onur Ulas"}],"citation-key":"inceCommerceEmpireDavid2017","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2971323","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,19]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 2971323","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Between Commerce and Empire: David Hume on Slavery, Political Economy, and Commercial Incivility","title-short":"Between Commerce and Empire","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2971323"},
  {"id":"incePhantasmagoriasNation2006","abstract":"This thesis presents an alternative approach to the notion of the \"imagined community of the nation\" by focusing on the role of aesthetics in the emergence of the modern nation. Within the framework of the late 18th-early 20th Century Europe, the thesis explores the modern transformations that gave rise to the nation from a perspective that establishes the convergence of aesthetics and politics as the central process through which the imagination of the nation is (re)produced. It designates unqualified, bodily, \"naked\" life as the grounds for this convergence, and traces the emergence of naked life through processes of its \"scientization\" by the discipline of psychophysiology, its \"aestheticization\" by phantasmagorical spectacles, and its \"politicization\" through its inscription in the national juridical order around the persona of the citizen. It contends that naked life that first emerged as an imaginable entity in psychophysiology was captured in aesthetic constellations by phantasmagorias, which were then appropriated by the project of nation-building for the forging of the national imaginary. The political function of the \"phantasmagorias of the nation\" is to uphold the mythical notion of predestination to the eternal present of the nation, which finds its corollary in the fateful subjection of citizens to the mythical violence of the nation-state. The thesis concludes by asserting that this particular conceptualization of the nation proves useful for qualifying the understanding of contemporary politics in general and the arguments about the decline of the nation in particular.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ince","given":"Onur Ulas"}],"citation-key":"incePhantasmagoriasNation2006","DOI":"10.14288/1.0092718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of British Columbia","source":"open.library.ubc.ca","title":"Phantasmagorias of the nation","type":"thesis","URL":"https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0092718"},

  {"id":"jacquesPoliticalMetaphysicsWorld1990","abstract":"The initial thesis of this dissertation concerned a textual imbalance in Nietzsche between Christianity and socialism: By his own assessments Christianity was already historically exhausted and therefore not an appropriate target for attack, whereas socialism, its young successor, was. The hypothesis was that Nietzsche's anti-Christianity was a mask for anti-socialism.    This led directly to an investigation of Nietzsche's politics, a matter traditionally much distorted, minimized, or denied. My studies show that not only is politics the most important aspect of Nietzsche's philosophy, it is the entire philosophy. Nietzsche's philosophy is a political metaphysics. So pervasive is the political (which is dualistic: master and slave), that Nietzsche's attempted monistic ontology--the will to power--was abandoned because incompatible with his metaphysics.    In this perspective, Christianity and socialism become assessable. Nietzsche's relation to Christianity progressively decays from a critical and superior description to a hysterical and vengeful antagonism: Nietzsche's anti-Christianity is a personal and German matter, not a philosophical and European one. In contrast, a progressively increasing concern with socialism, especially in what I identify as his fourth and fifth periods (following the traditional three), is not only European in tone and scope, but is future-looking and therefore justified in a way Christianity could not be. Thus I concluded that socialism is not masked by Christianity, but that nonetheless there is (by traditional assessments) a textual imbalance which is rectified by this systematic analysis.    Nietzsche's future-looking program is also now assessable. That is, the political consolidation of Europe by good Europeans and their domination of the earth for their advantage. However, I find, on morphological grounds, that with the failure of the two German war efforts in the twentieth century, Europe's last opportunity at unification and world leadership is over. Like the Hellenistic imitation of Greece, the world is now Europeanistic, Europe included. However, despite the untimely truncation of Nietzsche's career, I show that he anticipated his philosophy's inadequacy in the tetralogy Zarathustra, announcing its imminent failure in a satyr play.","archive":"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","archive_location":"303862630","author":[{"family":"Jacques","given":"Robert Arthur"}],"citation-key":"jacquesPoliticalMetaphysicsWorld1990","contributor":[{"family":"Rosen","given":"Stanley H."}],"event-place":"Ann Arbor","genre":"Ph.D.","ISBN":"9798617073173","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990]]},"language":"English","note":"9104895","number-of-pages":"218","publisher":"The Pennsylvania State University","publisher-place":"Ann Arbor","title":"Political metaphysics and the world imperialism of Friedrich Nietzsche","type":"thesis","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/political-metaphysics-world-imperialism-friedrich/docview/303862630/se-2?accountid=12874"},

  {"id":"jaimeerodriguezoPoliticalCultureSpanish2018","abstract":"Political Culture in Spanish America, 1500-1830examines the nature of Spanish American political culture by reevaluating the political theory, institutions, and practices of the Hispanic world. Consisting of eight case studies with a focus on New Spain and Quito, Jaime E. Rodríguez O. demonstrates that the process of independence of Spanish America differs from previous claims.In 1188 King Alfonso IX convened theCortes,the first congress in Europe that included the three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the towns. This heritage, along with events in the sixteenth century, including the rebellion of Castilla and the Protestant Reformation, transformed the nature of Hispanic political thought. Rodríguez O. argues that those developments, rather than the Enlightenment, were the basis of the Hispanic revolution and the Constitution of 1812. Emphasizing continuity rather than the rejection of Hispanic political culture, and including the Atlantic perspective,Political Culture in Spanish America, 1500-1830demonstrates the nature of the Hispanic revolution and the process of independence. Rodríguez O.'s work will encourage historians of Spanish America to reexamine the political institutions and processes of those nations from a broad perspective to gain a deeper understanding of the Spanish American countries that emerged from the breakup of the composite monarchy.","author":[{"literal":"JAIME E RODRÍGUEZ O"}],"citation-key":"jaimeerodriguezoPoliticalCultureSpanish2018","event-place":"Lincoln","ISBN":"978-1-4962-0088-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"UNP - Nebraska","publisher-place":"Lincoln","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Political Culture in Spanish America, 1500–1830","type":"book"},

The agency of Asian and North African activists in this programme remains largely unknown, and their wartime collaboration in Germany is an under-researched topic in the histories of anti-colonial activism. This article explores the collaboration between the three committees, highlighting their strategic relationships with German officials and with each other. Criticizing the Eurocentric framings still present in studies of wartime strategy, it contributes to a growing historiography on the war as a global conflict.

  {"id":"jimenezSlaveryRacismManumission2015","abstract":"On July 21, 1821, two years after the triumph of the Bolivarian Army over the Spanish Crown in Colombian territory, the Congress and the Executive Power approved a manumission law known as ‘Law of Free Wombs’ to gradually end the institution of slavery. Despite its “philanthropic intentions,” this law protected most slaveholders’ socioeconomic and political interests. Racism against people of African origin persisted and slavery was, as a matter of fact, maintained for more than three decades. Why slavery was not abolished in Colombia, as Simon Bolívar had promised, once the war for independence was won? Did racist ideas influence the debates on the manumission process and the abolition of slavery? How might one assess this thirty-years-long process? This paper seeks to answer these questions based on the analysis of relevant primary and secondary sources. The text contributes to the existing body of literature on both the manumission process and the history of racism in Colombia.","author":[{"family":"Jiménez","given":"Leonardo Reales"}],"citation-key":"jimenezSlaveryRacismManumission2015","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"21","source":"Zotero","title":"Slavery, racism and manumission in Colombia (1821-1851)","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"johnbeverleySubalternityRepresentationArguments1999","abstract":"The term \"subalternity\" refers to a condition of subordination brought about by colonization or other forms of economic, social, racial, linguistic, and/or cultural dominance. Subaltern studies is, therefore, a study of power. Who has it and who does not. Who is gaining it and who is losing it. Power is intimately related to questions of representation-to which representations have cognitive authority and can secure hegemony and which do not and cannot. In this book John Beverley examines the relationship between subalternity and representation by analyzing the ways in which that relationship has been played out in the domain of Latin American studies. Dismissed by some as simply another new fashion in the critique of culture and by others as a postmarxist heresy, subaltern studies began with the work of Ranajit Guha and the South Asian Subaltern Studies collective in the 1980s. Beverley's focus on Latin America, however, is evidence of the growing province of this field. In assessing subaltern studies' purposes and methods, the potential dangers it presents, and its interactions with deconstruction, poststructuralism, cultural studies, Marxism, and political theory, Beverley builds his discussion around a single, provocative question: How can academic knowledge seek to represent the subaltern when that knowledge is itself implicated in the practices that construct the subaltern as such? In his search for answers, he grapples with a number of issues, notably the 1998 debate between David Stoll and Rigoberta Menchú over her award-winning testimonial narrative, I, Rigoberta Menchú. Other topics explored include the concept of civil society, Florencia Mallon's influential Peasant and Nation, the relationship between the Latin American \"lettered city\" and the Túpac Amaru rebellion of 1780-1783, the ideas of transculturation and hybridity in postcolonial studies and Latin American cultural studies, multiculturalism, and the relationship between populism, popular culture, and the \"national-popular\" in conditions of globalization. This critique and defense of subaltern studies offers a compendium of insights into a new form of knowledge and knowledge production. It will interest those studying postcolonialism, political science, cultural studies, and Latin American culture, history, and literature.","author":[{"literal":"John Beverley"}],"citation-key":"johnbeverleySubalternityRepresentationArguments1999","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv125jkfh","ISBN":"978-0-8223-2382-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Duke University Press","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Subalternity and Representation: Arguments in Cultural Theory","title-short":"Subalternity and Representation","type":"book"},

For most of the text, the protagonist critiques poverty, but in the final pages he begins to idealize it. Some critics have understood Las estrellas son negras as a protest against state racism in Chocó and ignore or dismiss the novel’s ending. Another critic celebrates the ending, arguing that the protagonist proudly recognizes himself as a member of the African diaspora. While I agree that the protagonist takes on a new racial identity, I contend that the identity is gendered—a black masculinity—and that it has a resigned affect. I will argue that the novel allegorizes the defeat of leftist Afro-Colombian movements after the assassination of the populist leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán—a dark-skinned mestizo popularly known as “el negro Gaitán”—in 1948.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Benjamin S."}],"citation-key":"johnsonBlackMasculinityNegro2019","container-title":"Revista de estudios hispánicos (University, Ala.)","DOI":"10.1353/rvs.2019.0066","event-place":"St. Louis","ISSN":"0034-818X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"eng","page":"947–967","publisher":"Washington University in St. Louis","publisher-place":"St. Louis","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Black Masculinity after “el Negro Gaitán”: The Racial and Gender Politics of Arnoldo Palacios’s Las estrellas son negras","title-short":"Black Masculinity after “el Negro Gaitán”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://search.proquest.com/docview/2336267094?pq-origsite=primo","volume":"53"},

  {"id":"JusTriumLiberorum2020","abstract":"The ius trium liberorum, meaning \"the right of three children\" in Latin, was a privilege rewarded to Roman citizens who had produced at least three children or freedmen of both sexes who had produced at least four children.  It was a direct result of the Lex Iulia and the Lex Papia Poppaea, laws introduced by Augustus in 18 BC and 9 AD, respectively.  These laws were intended to increase the dwindling population of the Roman upper classes.\nThe intent of the ius trium liberorum had led scholars to interpret it as eugenic legislation. This interpretation is long outdated, however. Most current scholarship sees the law as a politically-motivated effort to increase birth rates among the senatorial class. Men who had received the jus trium liberorum were excused from munera (compulsory services).  Women with jus trium liberorum were no longer subject to tutela mulierum (guardianship by a male relative) and could receive inheritances which would otherwise descend to their children.The senatorial reaction to the jus trium liberorum was largely to find loopholes, however. The prospect of having a large family was still not appealing.  A person who caught a citizen in violation in this law was entitled to a portion of the inheritance involved, creating a lucrative business for professional spies.

  {"id":"kitnickDistantEarlyWarning2021","abstract":"Marshall McLuhan (1911–1980) is best known as a media theorist—many consider him the founder of media studies—but he was also an important theorist of art. Though a near-household name for decades due to magazine interviews and TV specials, McLuhan remains an underappreciated yet fascinating figure in art history. His connections with the art of his own time were largely unexplored, until now. In&nbsp; Distant Early Warning , art historian Alex Kitnick delves into these rich connections and argues both that McLuhan was influenced by art and artists and, more surprisingly, that McLuhan’s work directly influenced the art and artists of his time. &nbsp; Kitnick builds the story of McLuhan’s entanglement with artists by carefully drawing out the connections among McLuhan, his theories, and the artists themselves. The story is packed with big names: Marcel Duchamp, Niki de Saint Phalle, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Nam June Paik, and others. Kitnick masterfully weaves this history with McLuhan’s own words and his provocative ideas about what art is and what artists should do, revealing McLuhan’s influence on the avant-garde through the confluence of art and theory. The illuminating result sheds light on new aspects of McLuhan, showing him not just as a theorist, or an influencer, but as a richly multifaceted figure who, among his many other accolades, affected multiple generations of artists and their works. The book finishes with Kitnick overlaying McLuhan’s ethos onto the state of contemporary and post-internet art. This final channeling of McLuhan is a swift and beautiful analysis, with a personal touch, of art’s recent transgressions and what its future may hold.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kitnick","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"kitnickDistantEarlyWarning2021","ISBN":"978-0-226-75359-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,21]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Distant Early Warning","type":"book","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7208/9780226753591/html"},
  {"id":"klarerWomanArcadiaImpact1993","abstract":"With the discovery of the new continent in the fifteenth century, a number of existing literary traditions contributed to the creation of the early image of America. In particular, Utopian features were projected onto the terra incognita. The equation of the New World with the earthly paradise and the Promised Land placed America in the tradition of ancient and medieval Utopian texts. The early picture of America is an indirect continuation of an ambivalent gendered view of the world predominant in most Utopias and pastorals. On the one hand, America becomes the positive projection of a benevolent female Mother-Earth who provides for all basic human needs; on the other, a number of intimidating gendered topoi are intricately interwoven with these new territories. The “feminine” appears to be a central issue of literary as well as pictorial imagery in the first narratives on America. As early as Columbus and Vespucci, America was stylized or allegorized through female symbols and metaphors. This paper will try to show how ancient Utopian concepts such as visions of a gendered paradise, myths of Amazons and role reversals, as well as notions of “women communism” were integral components in the creation of America as a myth. They can be traced in the writings of Columbus and Vespucci as well as in the early illustrations of their books. A selection of textual samples and pictures will serve as a basis for the discussion of these inherent gender issues.","author":[{"family":"Klarer","given":"Mario"}],"citation-key":"klarerWomanArcadiaImpact1993","container-title":"Journal of American Studies","DOI":"10.1017/S0021875800032631","ISSN":"0021-8758","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"page":"1–17","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Woman and Arcadia: The Impact of Ancient Utopian Thought on the Early Image of America","title-short":"Woman and Arcadia","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"kleinImageAbsenceArchival2013","abstract":"In recent years, scholars from across the humanities, including literary critics Stephen Best and Saidiya Hartman, have theorized about how best to account for the silences endemic to the archive of American slavery. These critics call for a shift away from what Best has described as a “logic and ethic of recovery” to a new focus, instead, on animating the mysteries of the past. With the example of James Hemings, Thomas Jefferson’s enslaved chef (and Sally Hemings’s older brother), this essay shows how a set of techniques associated with the digital humanities—in particular, techniques that derive from the fields of computational linguistics and data visualization—can further illuminate these mysteries. It also describes how the unique demands of the archive of slavery pose challenges to the field of digital humanities as it is currently conceived. By contrasting a set of visualizations of Hemings’s archival trace with Jefferson’s own charts and tables, Klein demonstrates how we must rethink the empiricist epistemology of the visible that endures to this day. After a brief discussion of data visualization as it relates to the construction of race, Klein turns to the issue of labor, and concludes that Hemings’s culinary labor, when considered as techne, can inform discussions of digital labor today.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Klein","given":"Lauren F."}],"citation-key":"kleinImageAbsenceArchival2013","container-title":"American Literature","container-title-short":"American Literature","DOI":"10.1215/00029831-2367310","ISSN":"0002-9831","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,1]]},"page":"661-688","source":"Silverchair","title":"The Image of Absence: Archival Silence, Data Visualization, and James Hemings","title-short":"The Image of Absence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1215/00029831-2367310","volume":"85"},

  {"id":"lassoMythsHarmonyRace2007","abstract":"This book centers on a foundational moment for Latin American racial constructs. While most contemporary scholarship has focused the explanation for racial tolerance-or its lack-in the colonial period, Marixa Lasso argues that the key to understanding the origins of modern race relations are to be found later, in the Age of Revolution.\nLasso rejects the common assumption that subalterns were passive and alienated from Creole-led patriot movements, and instead demonstrates that during Colombia's revolution, free blacks and mulattos (pardos) actively joined and occasionally even led the cause to overthrow the Spanish colonial government. As part of their platform, patriots declared legal racial equality for all citizens, and promulgated an ideology of harmony and fraternity for Colombians of all colors. The fact that blacks were mentioned as equals in the discourse of the revolution and later served in republican government posts was a radical political departure. These factors were instrumental in constructing a powerful myth of racial equality-a myth that would fuel revolutionary activity throughout Latin America.\nThus emerged a historical paradox central to Latin American nation-building: the coexistence of the principle of racial equality with actual racism at the very inception of the republic. Ironically, the discourse of equality meant that grievances of racial discrimination were construed as unpatriotic and divisive acts-in its most extreme form, blacks were accused of preparing a race war. Lasso's work brings much-needed attention to the important role of the anticolonial struggles in shaping the nature of contemporary race relations and racial identities in Latin America.","author":[{"family":"Lasso","given":"Marixa"}],"citation-key":"lassoMythsHarmonyRace2007","collection-title":"acls fellows' publications","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctt5hjrmh","event-place":"Pittsburgh, PA","ISBN":"978-0-8229-4311-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of Pittsburgh Press","publisher-place":"Pittsburgh, PA","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Myths of harmony: race and republicanism during the age of revolution, Colombia 1795-1831","title-short":"Myths of harmony","type":"book"},

These fears and tensions reflect an evermore-interconnected global environment where increased mobility of people, technologies, and disease have produced great social, political, and economical uncertainty. The essays in this collection examine how monstrosity has been used to manage these rising fears and tensions. Analyzing popular films and televisions shows, such as True Blood, Twilight, Paranormal Activity, District 9, Battlestar Galactica, and Avatar, it argues that monstrous narratives of the past decade have become omnipresent specifically because they represent collective social anxieties over resisting and embracing change in the 21st century.

El punto de partida es que ese tipo de sociedades disponen, si nos referimos a su tecnología comunicativa, no de uno, sino de dos sistemas de comunicación verbal: el oral (o vocal) y el gestual. El sistema gestual, como el moderno lenguaje gestual destinado a los sordos, traduce, como la escritura, un discurso verbal; es por lo tanto —igual que los subtítulos en el cine—, una especie de escritura efímera. El uso de uno o de otro de los dos sistemas depende del contexto: la escritura gestual se usa en público y la oralidad vocal en la esfera íntima. En términos de la durabilidad de los dos sistemas, se sitúa la mirada hermenéutico-exegética en la dimensión κίνημα (cine, movimiento), recorriendo y recurriendo a poemas orales, mitos y mitografías, pinturas primordiales y lienzos precolombinos, además del diálogo con especialistas en la materia.","author":[{"family":"Lienhard","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"lienhardPensamientoHumanoSus2021","container-title":"Liminar (San Cristóbal de Las Casas, Mexico)","DOI":"10.29043/liminar.v19i2.839","ISSN":"1665-8027","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"eng ; spa","publisher":"Universidad de Ciencias y Artes de Chiapas","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"El pensamiento humano y sus materializaciones","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"LifeChristArt2022","abstract":"The Life of Christ as a narrative cycle in Christian art comprises a number of different subjects narrating the events from the life of Jesus on Earth.  They are distinguished from the many other subjects in art showing the eternal life of Christ, such as Christ in Majesty, and also many types of portrait or devotional subjects without a narrative element. \n\nThey are often grouped in series or cycles of works in a variety of media, from book illustrations to large cycles of wall paintings, and most of the subjects forming the narrative cycles have also been the subjects of individual works, though with greatly varying frequency.  By around 1000, the choice of scenes for the remainder of the Middle Ages became largely settled in the Western and Eastern churches, and was mainly based on the major feasts celebrated in the church calendars.\nThe most common subjects were grouped around the birth and childhood of Jesus, and the Passion of Christ, leading to his Crucifixion and Resurrection. Many cycles covered only one of these groups, and others combined the Life of the Virgin with that of Jesus. Subjects showing the life of Jesus during his active life as a teacher, before the days of the Passion, were relatively few in medieval art, for a number of reasons.  From the Renaissance, and in Protestant art, the number of subjects increased considerably, but cycles in painting became rarer, though they remained common in prints and especially book illustrations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,6]]},"citation-key":"LifeChristArt2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,3]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1108243569","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Life of Christ in art","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Life_of_Christ_in_art&oldid=1108243569"},

  {"id":"lindAmericanWayStrategy2006","abstract":"In The American Way of Strategy, Lind argues that the goal of U.S. foreign policy has always been the preservation of the American way of life--embodied in civilian government, checks and balances, a commercial economy, and individual freedom. Lind describes how successive American statesmen--from George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton to Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, and Ronald Reagan--have pursued an American way of strategy that minimizes the dangers of empire and anarchy by two means: liberal internationalism and realism. At its best, the American way of strategy is a well-thought-out and practical guide designed to preserve a peaceful and demilitarized world by preventing an international system dominated by imperial and militarist states and its disruption by anarchy. When American leaders have followed this path, they have led our nation from success to success, and when they have deviated from it, the results have been disastrous. Framed in an engaging historical narrative, the book makes an important contribution to contemporary debates. The American Way of Strategy is certain to change the way that Americans understand U.S. foreign policy.","author":[{"family":"Lind","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"lindAmericanWayStrategy2006","ISBN":"978-0-19-988579-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,10,2]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"320","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The American Way of Strategy: U.S. Foreign Policy and the American Way of Life","title-short":"The American Way of Strategy","type":"book"},

  {"id":"LinotypeMachine2021","abstract":"The Linotype machine ( LYNE-ə-type) was a \"line casting\" machine used in printing sold by the Mergenthaler Linotype Company and related companies. It was a hot metal typesetting system that cast blocks of metal type for individual uses. Linotype became one of the mainstay methods to set type, especially small-size body text, for newspapers, magazines, and posters from the late 19th century to the 1970s and 1980s, when it was largely replaced by phototypesetting and computer typesetting. The name of the machine comes from the fact that it produces an entire line of metal type at once, hence a line-o'-type, a significant improvement over the previous industry standard, i.e., manual, letter-by-letter typesetting using a composing stick and shallow subdivided trays, called \"cases\".\nThe linotype machine operator enters text on a 90-character keyboard. The machine assembles matrices, which are molds for the letter forms, in a line. The assembled line is then cast as a single piece, called a slug, from molten type metal in a process known as hot metal typesetting. The matrices are then returned to the type magazine from which they came, to be reused later. This allows much faster typesetting and composition than original hand composition in which operators place down one pre-cast glyph (metal letter, punctuation mark or space) at a time.\nThe machine revolutionized typesetting and with it especially newspaper publishing, making it possible for a relatively small number of operators to set type for many pages daily. Ottmar Mergenthaler invented the linotype in 1884.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,2]]},"citation-key":"LinotypeMachine2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1009654284","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Linotype machine","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linotype_machine&oldid=1009654284"},
  {"id":"linsribeiroWorldAnthropologiesAnthropological2014","abstract":"To present the world anthropologies project (WA), this article explores the existence of three kinds of anthropological cosmopolitanisms and cosmopolitics: imperial, liberal, and radical. Imperial cosmopolitics reproduces the hegemony of the Anglo-American core in the world system of anthropological production. Liberal cosmopolitics is a step ahead but naturalizes the West's prominent place in the global production of knowledge. Radical cosmopolitics is currently epitomized by the WA It problematizes AngloAmerican centrality and criticizes Eurocentrism. The WA is a hybrid of diverse theoretical and political debates. It has important singularities: It is not located in the discipline's center, and it is a political critique of and action against the existing global anthropological hierarchy. Critical transnationalism and cosmopolitanism are sources of inspiration for the WA The WA believes that anthropologists can take advantage of globalization's heterodox opportunities to go beyond metropolitan provincialism, to improve the conditions of conversability, and to benefit from the diversity of anthropologies and from the resulting heteroglossic cross-fertilizations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lins Ribeiro","given":"Gustavo"}],"citation-key":"linsribeiroWorldAnthropologiesAnthropological2014","container-title":"Annual Review of Anthropology","container-title-short":"Annu.

Drawing on postcolonial, ethnic, and critical race studies as well as recent literary and critical theory, it demonstrates that new cosmopolitan thinking can embrace an awareness of ethnic and local differences. It disputes the utopianism of colorblind universalism and argues for the persistence of “race” and racialized thinking in lived experience. The essays collected in this volume valorize minoritarian perspectives and urge readers to rethink cosmopolitanism from the perspective of the underprivileged and marginalized and highlight the role of culture in mobilizing social empathy and solidarity with the world’s precariat. The contributors, who come from over a dozen different countries and from diverse socio-cultural backgrounds, constitute a vibrant cosmopolitan community in itself.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Luczak","given":"Ewa Barbara"},{"family":"Pochmara","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Dayal","given":"Samir"}],"citation-key":"luczakNewCosmopolitanismsRace2019","ISBN":"978-3-11-062620-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,1]]},"language":"en","publisher":"De Gruyter","source":"www-degruyter-com.proxy.library.nd.edu","title":"New Cosmopolitanisms, Race, and Ethnicity: Cultural Perspectives","title-short":"New Cosmopolitanisms, Race, and Ethnicity","type":"book","URL":"https://www-degruyter-com.proxy.library.nd.edu/view/title/543009"},

Today we are living in an era of post sovereignty in which states are no more containers of security, economy and culture and borders have lost their role as military, economic and cultural barriers. As a result, new borderland theories have emerged. Innovative constructs are rooted in the idea that transnational integration generates spaces of economic, political and cultural interaction, creating new cross-border identities. However, borderland theories based on these new approaches suffer from cross-border euphoria because there are indications that the opening-up of the borders does not leave them as palimpsests of state sovereignty in the past. Therefore cross-border euphoria should be qualified for the following reasons: First, although economic cross-border interaction has increased, most interaction continues within the state. Second, politicocultural cohesion across the border has remained weak in borderlands. Third, the border continues dividing cultures and identities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Mansvelt Beck","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Hortelano Mínguez","given":"Luis Alfonso"}],"citation-key":"mansveltbeckAperturaFronteraNuevas2016","container-title":"Boletín de la Asociación de Geógrafos Españoles","container-title-short":"BAGE","DOI":"10.21138/bage.2340","ISSN":"0212-9426, 0212-9426","issue":"72","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,5]]},"language":"es","page":"14","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"La apertura de la frontera: ¿Nuevas identidades transfronterizas?","title-short":"La apertura de la frontera","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.age-geografia.es/ojs/index.php/bage/article/view/2340"},

In fact, the different variants of recursion theorems provide and explain constructions of self-replicating codes and, as a result, of various classes of malware.

He argues that globalization cannot be reduced to mere economics or summarized by phrases such as 'the end of history' or the 'westernization of the world'. Instead, we find ourselves embarking on a passage to a new, post-nation state age destined to transform all civilizations ' and to disrupt Western geopolitical dominance. To confront the challenges of this interregnum one must think in terms of a new and radical universalism, a universalism of difference able to revitalize politics and to demythologize identity. Building on the great interwar discussion between Spengler, Junger, Schmitt and Heidegger, Marramao's new work engages with Habermas, Derrida and post-colonialism. Arguing against the classic Western pretension to universal norms of democracy and reason, he develops instead the idea of a 'universal politics of difference'.","archive":"/z-wcorg/","author":[{"family":"Marramao","given":"Giacomo.","suffix":""}],"citation-key":"marramaoPassageWestPhilosophy2014","event-place":"[Place of publication not identified]","ISBN":"9781844679386 1844679381","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Verso","publisher-place":"[Place of publication not identified]","source":"http://worldcat.org","title":"The passage west : philosophy after the age of the nation state","type":"webpage","URL":"http://rbdigital.oneclickdigital.com"},
  {"id":"martinez-pinzonFiccionesOrigenOrigenes2021","abstract":"This essay approaches the ways in which Afro-Colombian intellectual, president and novelist, Juan José Nieto (1805-1866), represents Colombia as a new republic where education and personal merit, in contrast to lineage, are the sole purveyors of legitimacy to govern and write. In literary self-representations, Nieto erased his origins as a person of diverse racial origins and instead decided to represent himself as a \"new republican notability\" who made it to power through hard work. The present essay argues that Nieto, as the first writer of historical novels in Colombia, in his novel Ingermina o la hija de Calamar (1844), plots a new origin for the Republic - one akin to himself, mixed race, based on education and with popular support. As a new letrado in the midst of Romantic euphoria in the continent, Nieto would participate in debates about the origins of national literature for the new nations. As an outsider attacked because of his nonwhite origins, Nieto would contradictorily erase his own history and use the figure of French Romantic Alexandre Dumas, a novelist with Afro-Caribbean origins like himself, to legitimize his own public persona as a self-taught man and defender of republicanism. The essay concludes by suggesting that despite Nieto's strategies to found a Republic that would erase racial origins as providing legitimacy to occupy positions of power, he was erased from literary and political Colombian history for over 150 years precisely because his antagonists could not accept a nation, and a national literature, without origins in Europe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Martínez-Pinzón","given":"Felipe"}],"citation-key":"martinez-pinzonFiccionesOrigenOrigenes2021","container-title":"Romance quarterly","DOI":"10.1080/08831157.2021.1978357","event-place":"Washington","ISSN":"0883-1157","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"eng ; spa","page":"223–239","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"Washington","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Ficciones del origen y orígenes de la ficción en la obra de Juan José Nieto","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://search.proquest.com/docview/2584132394?pq-origsite=primo","volume":"68"},

  {"id":"mcgannTextualCondition1991","abstract":"Over the past decade literary critic and editor Jerome McGann has developed a theory of textuality based in writing and production rather than in reading and interpretation. These new essays extend his investigations of the instability of the physical text. McGann shows how every text enters the world under socio-historical conditions that set the stage for a ceaseless process of textual development and mutation. Arguing that textuality is a matter of inscription and articulation, he explores texts as material and social phenomena, as particular kinds of acts. McGann links his study to contextual and institutional studies of literary works as they are generated over time by authors, editors, typographers, book designers, marketing planners, and other publishing agents. This enables him to examine issues of textual stability and instability in the arenas of textual production and reproduction. Drawing on literary examples from the past two centuries--including works by Byron, Blake, Morris, Yeats, Joyce, and especially Pound--McGann applies his theory to key problems facing anyone who studies texts and textuality.","author":[{"family":"McGann","given":"Jerome J."},{"family":"Eley","given":"Geoff"},{"family":"Ortner","given":"Sherry B."},{"family":"Dirks","given":"Nicholas B."}],"citation-key":"mcgannTextualCondition1991","collection-title":"Princeton studies in culture/power/history","event-place":"Princeton, N.J.","ISBN":"978-0-691-21775-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991,10,27]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"232","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton, N.J.","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"The Textual Condition","type":"book"},

Similar to this, within media studies the central mediating factor of a given culture is the medium of communication itself. The popular conception of mediation refers to the reconciliation of two opposing parties by a third, and this is similar to its meaning in both Marxist theory and media studies.  For Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, this mediating factor is capital or alternately labor, depending on how one views capitalist society (capital is the dominant mediating factor, but labor is another mediating factor that could overthrow capital as the most important one).\nTo give a concrete example of this, a worker making shoes in a shoe factory is not only producing shoes, but potential exchange-value. The shoes are commodities that can be sold for cash. In this way, the value of the labor of the worker is the exchange-value of the shoes he or she produces minus his or her compensation. At the same time, however, the shoes produced have certain social or cultural values as well. In this way, the worker's labor is mediating between the economic or exchange-value of the shoes, and their social or cultural, or symbolic value.\nIn media studies, thinkers like Marshall McLuhan treat \"the medium is the message\" or the medium of a given social object (such as a book, CD, or television show) as the touchstone for both the cultural and material elements of the society in which this object exists. McLuhan is famous for critiquing the different types of cultural and material processes that are made available between print media (like books and magazines) and electronic media like television, radio, and film. While print requires thinking that is linear, chronological, and separate from the thinking of others, electronic media are considered more organic, simultaneous, and interdependent on other media and on other users of that media.\nMany thinkers are now considering how Marxist theory affects the way we think of media and vice versa, at the same time that new media are becoming a major form of communication. Contemporary media theorists often use elements of Marxist theory, such as mediation, to look at how new media affect social relations and lifestyles through their ability to communicate images, sounds, and other forms of information across the globe at incredible speeds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,2]]},"citation-key":"MediationMarxistTheory2020","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,24]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 996086827","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies)","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mediation_(Marxist_theory_and_media_studies)&oldid=996086827"},

Without paper, however, the invention of the moveable type printing press would have been insignificant. This crucial communication medium was hobbled by a critical shortage of the raw material needed for printed matter. Paper was in short supply in the colonies and in the new nation as it could only be made from rags, and there was constant difficulty in obtaining enough rags to keep the presses rolling. Pleas for this essential ingredient were constantly seen in the newspapers in early America and there were severe shortages of both paper and the rags from which it was made during the American Revolution.

  {"id":"mendietaPhilosophyLiberation2020","abstract":"Philosophy of Liberation is the collective name for a philosophicalmovement and method of doing philosophy that emerged at first inArgentina during the late sixties, but that went on to spreadthroughout Latin American during the early seventies. It is for thisreason that sometimes some critics and historiographers of thephilosophy of liberation make reference to a “strict” anda “broad” conception of the philosophy of liberation, inorder to refer to the immediate context of its earliest articulations,and to its later general dissemination and development. The philosophyof liberation belongs to the “maturity” stage within the“contemporary” period of Latin American philosophy, if weuse Jorge J.E. Gracia and Manuel Vargas’s periodization of LatinAmerican philosophy (Gracia and Vargas 2013). Without question,however, the philosophy of liberation is the distinct manifestation ofLatin American philosophy that has received the most internationalattention, and that has had the most influence both within LatinAmerica and the United States[1]., While the philosophy of liberation is deeply rooted in the history anddebates of Latin American philosophy, to the extent that it may beclaimed that it is the most elaborate and substantive response to thetask articulating a distinct Latin American philosophy, it isnonetheless also a chapter within the broader history of Europeanphilosophy. Even as it defines itself as a critique of Eurocentrismand the hegemony of European philosophy, it has evolved out of andmade use of its philosophical currents, movements, concepts anddebates. Some may be argue that the philosophy of liberation belongsto phenomenology, hermeneutics, and Marxism, or more generally,historical materialism. In fact, because many philosophers ofliberation came out of these different traditions, the philosophy ofliberation was and remains from the outset an internally heterogeneousmovement. This heterogeneity has increased as some philosophers haveengaged in what Enrique Dussel has called a “South-SouthDialogue,” in which philosophies from the so-called“global south” address each other directly withoutdeferring to the authority of dominant Euro-American philosophy(Dussel 2015)., The philosophy of liberation aims to think the distinct place and roleof Latin American in world history using what are argued to beautochthonous cultural and intellectual resources, from out of asituation of economic, cultural, political, and philosophicaldependency. It has a practical aim: liberation. In very general terms,the philosophy of liberation defines itself as a counter-philosophicaldiscourse, whether it be as a critique of colonialism, imperialism,globalization, racism, and sexism, which is articulated from out ofthe experience of exploitation, destitution, alienation andreification, in the name of the projects of liberation, autonomy andauthenticity. That is, the philosophy of liberation has presenteditself as an “epistemic rupture” that aims to critique andchallenge not only basic assumptions and themes of Euro-Americanphilosophy, but also to make philosophy more responsive to andresponsible for the socio-political situation in which it always findsitself. Thus, by “counter-philosophical discourse”,philosophers of liberation did not mean that it was“anti-philosophical”. Instead, they meant to emphasize aheightened degree of reflexiveness or self-awareness in theirtheorizing. Positively, the philosophy of liberation affirms culturaldiversity, gender and racial equality, and political sovereignty. Inmore recent years, some philosophers of liberation have been using thelanguage of “pluriversality,” instead of“universality,” to refer to this fundamental affirmationand celebration of global cultural diversity (Dussel 2015; Mignolo2011). The philosophy of liberation’s philosophical orbit isdefined by the axes of critique, commitment, engagement, andliberation. As a critique of all forms of philosophical dependency andinauthenticity, it is consciously and avowedly a metaphilosophy. Thephilosophy of liberation is thus, among other things, a view aboutwhat counts as philosophy and how it should be pursued., This article is divided into four main parts: history, background,currents, and themes and debates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Mendieta","given":"Eduardo"}],"citation-key":"mendietaPhilosophyLiberation2020","container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Winter 2020","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Philosophy of Liberation","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entries/liberation/"},

  {"id":"Metafisica2022","abstract":"La metafísica (del latín metaphysica, y este del griego μετὰ [τὰ] φυσικά, «más allá de la naturaleza»)[1]​ es la rama de la filosofía que estudia la naturaleza, estructura, componentes y principios fundamentales de la realidad.[2]​[3]​[4]​ Esto incluye la clarificación e investigación de algunas de las nociones fundamentales con las que comprendemos el mundo, como entidad, ser, existencia, objeto, propiedad, relación, causalidad, tiempo y espacio. Junto con la lógica y la gnoseología, la metafísica es la rama más básica de la filosofía. Ha sido estudiada por filósofos como Platón, Aristóteles, Agustín, Boecio, Aquino, Leibniz, Locke, etc.[5]​\nAntes del advenimiento de la ciencia moderna, muchos de los problemas que hoy pertenecen a las ciencias naturales eran estudiados por la metafísica bajo el título de filosofía natural.[6]​[7]​ Hoy la metafísica estudia aspectos de la realidad que son inaccesibles a la investigación empírica. Según Immanuel Kant, las afirmaciones metafísicas no se pueden dar en juicios sintéticos a priori, lo que excluye que la metafísica pueda constituirse en ciencia positiva al estilo de la física o las matemáticas.[8]​ Esto dará lugar en el siglo XX a la lectura heideggeriana de la metafísica occidental como ontoteología y, por lo tanto, a la necesidad de repensar la cuestión del ser desde el origen mismo de los pensadores presocráticos. Aristóteles designó la metafísica como «ciencia primera».[9]​ En la química se asume la existencia de la materia y en la biología la existencia de la vida, pero ninguna de las dos ciencias define la materia o la vida; solo la metafísica suministra estas definiciones básicas.[10]​\nLa ontología es la parte de la metafísica que se ocupa de investigar qué entidades existen y cuáles no, más allá de las apariencias.[11]​[12]​ La metafísica tiene dos temas principales: el primero es la ontología, que en palabras de Aristóteles es la ciencia que estudia al ser en cuanto tal. El segundo es la teleología, que estudia los fines como causa última de la realidad. Existe, sin embargo, un debate que sigue aún hoy sobre la definición del objeto de estudio de la metafísica, y sobre si sus enunciados tienen propiedades cognitivas.\nEs difícil encontrar una definición adecuada de metafísica.[5]​ A lo largo de los siglos, muchos filósofos han sostenido de alguna manera u otra, que la metafísica es imposible.[13]​ Esta tesis tiene una versión fuerte y una versión débil.[13]​ La versión fuerte es que todas las afirmaciones metafísicas carecen de sentido o significado.[13]​ Esto depende por supuesto de una teoría del significado.[13]​ Ludwig Wittgenstein y los positivistas lógicos fueron defensores explícitos de esta posición. Por otra parte, la versión débil es que si bien las afirmaciones metafísicas poseen significado, es imposible saber cuáles son verdaderas y cuáles falsas, pues esto va más allá de las capacidades cognitivas del hombre.[13]​ Esta posición es la que sostuvieron, por ejemplo, David Hume e Immanuel Kant. Por otra parte, algunos filósofos han sostenido que el ser humano tiene una predisposición natural hacia la metafísica. Kant la calificó de «necesidad inevitable», y Arthur Schopenhauer incluso definió al ser humano como «animal metafísico».","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,15]]},"citation-key":"Metafisica2022","container-title":"Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,19]]},"language":"es","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 146744374","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Metafísica","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metaf%C3%ADsica&oldid=146744374"},

Using various popular bands (including Thee Midniters, Los Lobos, Carlos Santana, and Rudy and Steve) to illustrate his formula, Loza indicates the ways in which Chicano artists often performed in the musical styles of African Americans, imitating the sound qualities of another marginalized people in the United States, which he defines as assimilation, although he offers the caveat that \"assimilation is not acculturation\" (138). Musicians' rejection of the previous two steps, according to Loza, resulted in music and bands that represent contemporary Chicano musical expression (Linda Ronstadt's use of mariachi on network television in the United States, groups with names such as Rage Against the Machine, the Filthy Immigrants) that ultimately generated surprising sales. Loza's essay ultimately reveals the tensions in rock music in general, a genre that has significant Latin roots from far prior to artists like Ritchie Valens.

  {"id":"MexicanTexas2021","abstract":"Mexican Texas is the historiographical name used to refer to the era of Texan history between 1821 and 1836, when it was part of Mexico. Mexico gained independence in 1821 after winning its war against Spain, which began in 1810. Initially, Mexican Texas operated similarly to Spanish Texas. Ratification of the 1824 Constitution of Mexico created a federal structure, and the province of Tejas was joined with the province of Coahuila to form the state of Coahuila y Tejas.\nIn 1821, approximately 3,500 settlers lived in the whole of Tejas, concentrated mostly in San Antonio and La Bahia, although authorities had tried to encourage development along the frontier. The settler population was overwhelmingly outnumbered by indigenous people in the province. To increase settler numbers, Mexico enacted the General Colonization Law in 1824, which enabled all heads of household, regardless of race, religion or immigrant status, to acquire land in Mexico.\nThe first empresarial grant had been made under Spanish control to Stephen F. Austin, whose settlers, known as the Old Three Hundred, settled along the Brazos River in 1822. The grant was later ratified by the Mexican government. Twenty-three other empresarios brought settlers to the state, the majority coming from the American South, while only one colony was settled by Mexican nationals, and two by European immigrants.\nMexico officials became concerned about attitudes among the Anglo-Americans in Tejas, for instance, their insistence on bringing slaves into the territory. The legislature passed the Law of April 6, 1830, which prohibited further immigration by U.S. citizens. The government established several new presidios in the region to monitor immigration and customs practices. Angry colonists held a convention in 1832 to demand that U.S. citizens be allowed to immigrate to Tejas. At a convention the following year, colonists proposed that Texas become a separate Mexican state. Although Mexico implemented several measures to appease the colonists, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's measures to transform Mexico from a federalist to a centralist state appeared to be the catalyst for the Anglo-Texan colonists to revolt.\nThe first violent incident occurred on June 26, 1832, at the Battle of Velasco. On March 2, 1836, Texians declared their independence from Mexico. The Texas Revolution ended on April 21, 1836, when Santa Anna was taken prisoner by Texians following the Battle of San Jacinto. Although Texas declared its independence as the Republic of Texas, Mexico refused to recognize Texas as a new country.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,5]]},"citation-key":"MexicanTexas2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,2]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1015673890","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Mexican Texas","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mexican_Texas&oldid=1015673890"},

  {"id":"MinstrelShow2021","abstract":"The minstrel show, or minstrelsy, was an American form of racist entertainment developed in the early 19th century. Each show consisted of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music performances that depicted people specifically of African descent. The shows were performed by mostly white people in make-up or blackface for the purpose of playing the role of black people. There were also some African-American performers and black-only minstrel groups that formed and toured. Minstrel shows lampooned black people as dim-witted, lazy, buffoonish, superstitious, and happy-go-lucky.Minstrel shows emerged as brief burlesques and comic entr'actes in the early 1830s in the Northeastern states. They were developed into full-fledged form in the next decade. By 1848, blackface minstrel shows were the national artform, translating formal art such as opera into popular terms for a general audience.By the turn of the 20th century, the minstrel show enjoyed but a shadow of its former popularity, having been replaced for the most part by vaudeville. The form survived as professional entertainment until about 1910; amateur performances continued until the 1960s in high schools and local theaters.The genre has had a lasting legacy and influence and was featured in a television series as recently as 1975. Generally, as the civil rights movement progressed and gained acceptance, minstrels lost popularity.\nThe typical minstrel performance followed a three-act structure. The troupe first danced onto stage then exchanged wisecracks and sang songs. The second part featured a variety of entertainments, including the pun-filled stump speech. The final act consisted of a slapstick musical plantation skit or a send-up of a popular play.\nMinstrel songs and sketches featured several stock characters, most popularly the slave and the dandy. These were further divided into sub-archetypes such as the mammy, her counterpart the old darky, the provocative mulatto wench, and the black soldier. Minstrels claimed that their songs and dances were authentically black, although the extent of the black influence remains debated. Spirituals (known as jubilees) entered the repertoire in the 1870s, marking the first undeniably black music to be used in minstrelsy.\nBlackface minstrelsy was the first theatrical form that was distinctly American. During the 1830s and 1840s at the height of its popularity, it was at the epicenter of the American music industry. For several decades, it provided the means through which American whites viewed black people. On the one hand, it had strong racist aspects; on the other, it afforded white Americans more awareness, albeit distorted, of some aspects of black culture in America.Although the minstrel shows were extremely popular, being \"consistently packed with families from all walks of life and every ethnic group\", they were also controversial. Integrationists decried them as falsely showing happy slaves while at the same time making fun of them; segregationists thought such shows were \"disrespectful\" of social norms as they portrayed runaway slaves with sympathy and would undermine the Southerners' \"peculiar institution\".","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"citation-key":"MinstrelShow2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,21]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1013343658","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Minstrel show","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minstrel_show&oldid=1013343658"},

  {"id":"mirandaCelebrityExilicRomance2016","abstract":"This comparative analysis argues that Lord Byron’s celebrity, and the ways in which he sought to deploy it, was anticipated by Francisco de Miranda (1750–1816), the Venezuelan exile, adventurer, and revolutionary. Miranda inspired a type of transnational celebrity classiﬁed here as “exilic romance.” Deﬁned by the appropriation and performance of several often contradictory identities, exilic romance operated as a living text, one that was being constantly edited, revised, and reinterpreted. Its many poses, which included the reinterpretation of courtly love, episodic adventure, and erotic symbolism, drew on literary genres (romance, picaresque, epic, and drama) and on classic Hispanic cultural symbols (such as El Cid, Don Juan, Don Quixote, and el pícaro). These literary “reenactments” were shaped in numerous ways by exile: the exotic distance of physical, cultural, and anachronistic separation that existed between the celebrity object and his public reception. This exilic distance enabled a ﬂuid celebrity form of myriad personae that became the foundation for the subversive agency that critics have commonly associated with Byron’s elusive classiﬁcation. In proposing that Miranda’s celebrity preﬁgured Byron’s, this argument shows how exilic romance captured the political and cultural imagination on both sides of the Atlantic for four decades through the public fascination with Miranda’s and Byron’s lives and how Byron made the fascination and elusiveness of exilic romance one of the subjects of Don Juan.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Miranda","given":"Omar F."}],"citation-key":"mirandaCelebrityExilicRomance2016","container-title":"European Romantic Review","container-title-short":"European Romantic Review","DOI":"10.1080/10509585.2016.1140045","ISSN":"1050-9585, 1740-4657","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,3]]},"language":"en","page":"207-231","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Celebrity of Exilic Romance: Francisco de Miranda and Lord Byron","title-short":"The Celebrity of Exilic Romance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10509585.2016.1140045","volume":"27"},

The analysis of records, proclamations, and reports of this event, as well as of materials regarding the incorporation of the province, reveals not only the strength of the municipal institutions, but also the fact that Gran Colombia was based on a contractualist conception of power.

Drawing on precise and detailed study of the contexts of different types of print, including books, pamphlets, newspapers and flysheets, combined with quantitative analysis and a study of texts as material objects, Thomas Munck offers a transformed picture of early modern political culture, and through analysis of new styles and genres of writing he offers a fresh perspective on the intended readership. Conflict and Enlightenment uses a resolutely comparative approach to re-examine what was being disseminated in print, and how. By mapping the transmission of texts across cultural and linguistic divides, Munck reveals how far new forms of political discourse varied depending on the particular perspectives of authors, readers and regulatory authorities, as well as the cultural adaptability of translators and sponsors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Munck","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"munckConflictEnlightenmentPrint2019","DOI":"10.1017/9781139021289","event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-521-87807-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Conflict and Enlightenment: Print and Political Culture in Europe, 1635–1795","title-short":"Conflict and Enlightenment","type":"book","URL":"https://www-cambridge-org.proxy.library.nd.edu/core/books/conflict-and-enlightenment/9B030231A2BCD7FD09C4CA35C4E4C8E9"},

  {"id":"munozClassicsSouthAmerica2021","abstract":"This volume examines the long and complex history of the Greco-Roman tradition in South America, arguing that the Classics have played a crucial, though often overlooked, role in the self-definition in the New World. Chronicling and theorizing this history through a detailed analysis of five key moments, chosen from the early and late colonial period, the emancipatory era, and the 20th and 21st centuries, it also examines an eclectic selection of both literary and cinematographic works and artefacts such as maps, letters, scientific treatises, songs, monuments, political speeches, and even the drafts of proposals for curricular changes across Latin America.   The heterogeneous cases analysed in this book reveal cultural anxieties that recur through different periods, fundamentally related to the 'newness' of the continent and the formation of identities imagined as both Western and non-Western – a genealogy of apprehensions that South American intellectuals and political figures have typically experienced when thinking of their own role in world history. In tracing this genealogy, The Classics in South America innovatively reformulates our understanding of well-known episodes in the cultural history of the region, while providing a theoretical and historical resource for further studies of the importance of the Classical tradition across Latin America.","author":[{"family":"Muñoz","given":"Germán Campos"}],"citation-key":"munozClassicsSouthAmerica2021","ISBN":"978-1-350-17026-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,8]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"273","publisher":"Bloomsbury Publishing","source":"Google Books","title":"The Classics in South America: Five Case Studies","title-short":"The Classics in South America","type":"book"},

The US was ultimately more successful than Gran Colombia at adapting its financial and monetary capacities and institutions, creating better conditions for the attainment of ‘stateness’, stronger economic growth, and greater endurance as a national entity. The comparison ultimately suggests a reciprocal relationship between the legitimization of a state’s authority (that is, state consolidation) and the development and solidification of fiscal and monetary capacities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Muse-Fisher","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"muse-fisherFinancingNewNation2012","container-title":"Journal of Global History","container-title-short":"Journal of Global History","DOI":"10.1017/S1740022811000568","ISSN":"1740-0228, 1740-0236","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3]]},"language":"en","page":"3-26","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Financing a new nation: a comparative study of the financial roots of the USA and Gran Colombia","title-short":"Financing a new nation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1740022811000568/type/journal_article","volume":"7"},

Democracy has come to manifest a tension between the 'autonomy' of the political and a 'heteronomy' that, exceeding rationalist or social contractarian accounts of our co-existence, is here presented as an irreducible affect of our being together. Autonomy, it is argued, resists heteronomy through all representations of democracy; yet, by contrast, heteronomy resists autonomy, and does so with the force of this affect. So if civil religion is impossible - and if we know only too well where its realizations lead: by default, to republican celebration, or by excess, to fascism - then we must take up again, and from scratch, the question of the affect according to which we co-exist.","author":[{"family":"Nancy","given":"Jean-Luc"}],"citation-key":"nancyChurchStateResistance2007","container-title":"Journal of law and society","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-6478.2007.00378.x","event-place":"Oxford, UK","ISSN":"0263-323X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"eng","page":"3–13","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher-place":"Oxford, UK","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Church, State, Resistance","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},
  {"id":"nancyCommerceThinkingBooks2009","abstract":"Jean-Luc Nancy's On the Commerce of Thinking concerns the particular communication of thoughts that takes place by means of the business of writing, producing, and selling books. His reflection is born out of his relation to the bookstore, in the first place his neighborhood one, but beyond that any such perfumery, rotisserie, patisserie,as he calls them, dispensaries of scents and flavors through which something like a fragrance or bouquet of the book is divined, presumed, sensed.On the Commerce of Thinking is thus not only something of a semiology of the specific cultural practice that begins with the unique character of the writer's voice and culminates in a customer crossing the bookstore threshold, package under arm, on the way home to a comfortable chair, but also an understated yet persuasive plea in favor of an endangered species. In evoking the peddler who, in times past, plied the streets with books and pamphlets literally hanging off him, Nancy emphasizes the sensuality of this commerce and reminds us that this form of consumerism is like no other, one that ends in an experience-reading-that is the beginning of a limitless dispersion, metamorphosis, and dissemination of ideas. Making, selling, and buying books has all the elements of the exchange economy that Marx analyzed--from commodification to fetishism--yet each book retains throughout an absolute and unique value, that of its subject. With reading, it gets repeatedly reprinted and rebound. For Nancy, the book thus functions only if it remains at the same time open and shut, like some Moebius strip. Closed, it represents the Idea and takes its place in a canon by means of its monumental form and the title and author's name displayed on its spine. But it also opens itself to us, indeed consents to being shaken to its core, in being read each time anew.","author":[{"family":"Nancy","given":"Jean-Luc"}],"citation-key":"nancyCommerceThinkingBooks2009","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-8232-3036-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Fordham University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"On the Commerce of Thinking: Of Books and Bookstores","title-short":"On the Commerce of Thinking","type":"book"},

An uncertain and erratic question, because the ‘where’ of that question remains obscure to me: where indeed are the possible ‘places’? Without a doubt it is necessary to rework the entire topography.

  {"id":"NarrativeArthurGordon2021","abstract":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) is the only complete novel written by American writer Edgar Allan Poe. The work relates the tale of the young Arthur Gordon Pym, who stows away aboard a whaling ship called the Grampus. Various adventures and misadventures befall Pym, including shipwreck, mutiny, and cannibalism, before he is saved by the crew of the Jane Guy. Aboard this vessel, Pym and a sailor named Dirk Peters continue their adventures farther south. Docking on land, they encounter hostile black-skinned natives before escaping back to the ocean. The novel ends abruptly as Pym and Peters continue toward the South Pole.\nThe story starts out as a fairly conventional adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly strange and hard to classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from Jeremiah N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on the potential autobiographical elements as well as its portrayal of race and the symbolism in the final lines of the work.\nDifficulty in finding literary success early in his short story-writing career inspired Poe to pursue writing a longer work. A few serialized installments of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket were first published in the Southern Literary Messenger, though never completed. The full novel was published in July 1838 in two volumes. Some critics responded negatively to the work for being too gruesome and for cribbing heavily from other works, while others praised its exciting adventures. Poe himself later called it \"a very silly book\". In the years since its publication, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket became an influential work, notably for Herman Melville and Jules Verne.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,11]]},"citation-key":"NarrativeArthurGordon2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1008443537","source":"Wikipedia","title":"<i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</i>","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Narrative_of_Arthur_Gordon_Pym_of_Nantucket&oldid=1008443537"},

Engaging with recent gossip theory and Svetlana Boym’s work on nostalgia, I view Cabrera as leveraging gossip’s illicit pleasures to recirculate suppressed stories and reinserting himself into the Cuban canon. Cabrera’s gossip becomes common knowledge, preserving the memory of numerous Cuban intellectuals and consolidating Cabrera’s own canonical status. Cabrera thus validates gossip as a nostalgic act: enduring rather than ephemeral, and a potent narrative strategy rather than merely an aesthetic posture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Navas","given":"Ana Rodríguez"}],"citation-key":"navasCHISMESCIUDADLETRADA2022","container-title":"Perífrasis.

The steady journey of the U.S. toward a majority nonwhite population, the ongoing evisceration of the political legacy of the early post-World War II civil rights movement, the initiation of the ‘war on terror’ with its attendant Islamophobia, the rise of a mass immigrants rights movement, the formulation of race/class/gender ‘intersectionality’ theories, and the election and reelection of a black President of the United States are some of the many new racial conditions Racial Formation now covers.","author":[{"family":"Omi","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Winant","given":"Howard"}],"citation-key":"omiRacialFormationUnited2014","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,7,1]]},"source":"Amazon","title":"Racial Formation in the United States","type":"book"},

  {"id":"osbaldestinArtEphemeraTypographic2020","abstract":"During the nineteenth century jobbing printers in Britain played an important role in the history of printing. In the skilled hands of the provincial printer, new display types were composed into new forms of advertising, contributing to the education and societal orientation of the emergent middle classes. Jobbing printers of the Midlands contributed to the advancement of British typography, making significant innovations in the composition of printed ephemera. This article considers the craft and invention of three influential nineteenth-century jobbing printers in the region: William Joesbury (1838–1919) of Birmingham, and the two members of the Gitton family, George (1746–1825) and George Robert (1801–85) of Bridgnorth. Joesbury printed Timothy Worsey Watton’s Outline Charts of General History (1848), an early example of progressive visual education for grammar schools; and the Gittons printed ephemera of Bridgnorth is a valuable record of the town’s industry and of its social culture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Osbaldestin","given":"David Joseph"}],"citation-key":"osbaldestinArtEphemeraTypographic2020","container-title":"Midland History","DOI":"10.1080/0047729X.2020.1767975","ISSN":"0047-729X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,3]]},"page":"208-221","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Art of Ephemera: Typographic Innovations of Nineteenth-Century Midland Jobbing Printers","title-short":"The Art of Ephemera","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0047729X.2020.1767975","volume":"45"},
  {"id":"osborneWalterBenjamin2020","abstract":"Walter Benjamin’s importance as a philosopher and criticaltheorist can be gauged by the diversity of his intellectual influenceand the continuing productivity of his thought. Primarily regarded as aliterary critic and essayist, the philosophical basis ofBenjamin’s writings is increasingly acknowledged. They were adecisive influence upon Theodor W. Adorno’s conception ofphilosophy’s actuality or adequacy to the present (Adorno 1931).In the 1930s, Benjamin’s efforts to develop a politicallyoriented, materialist aesthetic theory proved an important stimulusfor both the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory and the Marxist poetand dramatist Bertolt Brecht.  , The delayed appearance of Benjamin’s collected writings has determinedand sustained the Anglophone reception of his work. (A two-volumeselection was published in German in 1955, with a full edition notappearing until 1972–89, and a 21-volume critical edition has been in production since 2008; English anthologies first appeared in1968 and 1978, and the four-volume Selected Writings between1996 and 2003.) Originally received in the context of literarytheory and aesthetics, only in the last decades of the 20th century did the philosophical depth and cultural breadth of Benjamin’s thought begin to be fully appreciated. Despite the voluminous size of the secondary literaturethat it has produced, his work remains a continuing source ofproductivity. An understanding of the intellectual context of his workhas contributed to the philosophical revival of Early GermanRomanticism. His philosophy of language has played a seminal role in translation theory. His essay on ‘The Work of Art in the Age of ItsTechnical Reproducibility’ remains a major theoretical text forfilm theory. One-Way Street and the work arising from hisunfinished research on nineteenth century Paris (The ArcadesProject), provide a theoretical stimulus for cultural theory andphilosophical concepts of the modern. Benjamin’s messianicunderstanding of history has been an enduring source of theoreticalfascination and frustration for a diverse range of philosophicalthinkers, including Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben and, in acritical context, Jürgen Habermas. The ‘Critique ofViolence’ and ‘On the Concept of History’ areimportant sources for Derrida’s discussion of messianicity, which hasbeen influential, along with Paul de Man’s discussion of allegory, forthe poststructuralist reception of Benjamin’s writings. Aspects ofBenjamin’s thought have also been associated with a revival ofpolitical theology, although it is doubtful this reception is true tothe tendencies of Benjamin’s own political thought. More recently,interest in Benjamin’s philosophy of education has been fueled by thetranslations of his Early Writings in 2011 and thetranscripts of his radio broadcasts for children (RadioBenjamin) in 2014.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Osborne","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Charles","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"osborneWalterBenjamin2020","container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Winter 2020","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Walter Benjamin","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entries/benjamin/"},

  {"id":"ovendenBurningBooksHistory2020","abstract":"\"The director of the famed Bodleian Libraries at Oxford narrates the global history of the willful destruction--and surprising survival--of recorded knowledge over the past three millennia. Libraries and archives have been attacked since ancient times but have been especially threatened in the modern era. Today the knowledge they safeguard faces purposeful destruction and willful neglect; deprived of funding, libraries are fighting for their very existence. Burning the Books recounts the history that brought us to this point. Richard Ovenden describes the deliberate destruction of knowledge held in libraries and archives from ancient Alexandria to contemporary Sarajevo, from smashed Assyrian tablets in Iraq to the destroyed immigration documents of the United Kingdom's Windrush generation. He examines both the motivations for these acts -- political, religious, and cultural -- and the broader themes that shape this history. He also looks at attempts to prevent and mitigate attacks on knowledge, exploring the efforts of librarians and archivists to preserve information, often risking their own lives in the process. More than simply repositories for knowledge, libraries and archives inspire and inform citizens. In preserving notions of statehood recorded in such historical documents as the Declaration of Independence, libraries support the state itself. By preserving records of citizenship and records of the rights of citizens as enshrined in legal documents such as the Magna Carta and the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, they support the rule of law. In Burning the Books, Ovenden takes a polemical stance on the social and political importance of the conservation and protection of knowledge, challenging governments in particular, but also society as a whole, to improve public policy and funding for these essential institutions\".--Résumé de l'éditeur.","author":[{"family":"Ovenden","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"ovendenBurningBooksHistory2020","ISBN":"978-0-674-24120-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1240181015","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Burning the books: a history of the deliberate destruction of knowledge","title-short":"Burning the books","type":"book"},

  {"id":"paicAuraTechnologyWork2021","abstract":"In the famous essay from 1935/1936 The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility (Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit), Walter Benjamin introduces a highly ambiguous concept of “aura” in the philosophical and historical discourse of aesthetics. Aura blends motifs of Greek mythology, Jewish Kabbalistic and eschatology, echoes of esotericism and occultism, the modern experience of transcending the boundaries of the material world of phenomena, the bohemian experience of poets and artists from Baudelaire to the Surrealists, and the practice of opium and hashish users. Isn’t it truly “shocking” and “provocative” that the key concept of modern and contemporary art—aura, which has managed to survive in the contemporary age of the technosphere—encompasses all speculative-metaphysical, hybrid and manifold meanings precisely because it speaks of the power of image over language? So, despite his mimetic theory of language, Walter Benjamin opened the door to philosophy and art, starting from the “pictorial nature” of language.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Paić","given":"Žarko"}],"citation-key":"paicAuraTechnologyWork2021","container-title":"The Palgrave Handbook of Image Studies","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-71830-5_16","editor":[{"family":"Purgar","given":"Krešimir"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-71830-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"265-280","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Aura, Technology, and the Work of Art in Walter Benjamin","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-71830-5_16"},

Since this historical periodisation was first established in the 1950s, the avant-garde’s futurity has been repeatedly disputed, bringing the very notion of an avant-garde into question. This thesis takes as its starting point the predicament of ‘an avant-garde after the avant-garde’ as a means to investigate the philosophico-political implications of a historical temporality marked by ‘afterness’. Writing in critical dialogue with scholarship that has articulated the avant-garde as a notion of historical time, the thesis modifies the parameters of this scholarship by foregrounding the category of historicism, and by reformulating the avant-garde as a notion that both resists and inhabits historical periodisation. As a study at the disciplinary intersection of comparative literature and critical theory, 'Ahead of its Time' proceeds via close readings of selected theories of the avant-garde (German literary scholar Peter Bürger’s foundational Theory of the Avant-Garde in the 1970s; British art theorist John Roberts’ formulation of a ‘suspensive avant-garde’ in the twenty-first century; and the intellectual debates of the Italian circle Neoavanguardia in the 1960s), while also mobilising the critical resources available in the thought of Walter Benjamin. Through a non-linear, comparativist critical analysis that discusses these theories in, and as, a Benjaminian constellation, the thesis proposes the avant-garde as a relational, indexical category that is constitutively split between historical continuity and historical rupture. In this manner, 'Ahead of its Time' revisits the broader question of mediation between universality and particularity, and by recasting it in temporal terms, it advocates a chronopolitics of singularity, whereby the avant-garde’s split between continuity and rupture also reveals the ethically-necessary relationship between self-determination and contingency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Papaioannou","given":"Chrysi Andriani"}],"citation-key":"papaioannouAheadItsTime2017","genre":"phd","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,30]]},"language":"en","license":"cc_by_nc_sa","number-of-pages":"260","publisher":"University of Leeds","source":"etheses.whiterose.ac.uk","title":"Ahead of its Time: Historicity, Chronopolitics, and the Idea of the Avant-Garde after Modernism","title-short":"Ahead of its Time","type":"thesis","URL":"https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/16922/"},

  {"id":"parikkaGeologyMedia2015","abstract":"Media history is millions, even billions, of years old. That is the premise of this pioneering and provocative book, which argues that to adequately understand contemporary media culture we must set out from material realities that precede media themselves-Earth's history, geological formations, minerals, and energy. And to do so, writes Jussi Parikka, is to confront the profound environmental and social implications of this ubiquitous, but hardly ephemeral, realm of modern-day life. Exploring the resource depletion and material resourcing required for us to use our devices to live networked lives, Parikka grounds his analysis in Siegfried Zielinski's widely discussed notion of deep time-but takes it back millennia. Not only are rare earth minerals and many other materials needed to make our digital media machines work, he observes, but used and obsolete media technologies return to the earth as residue of digital culture, contributing to growing layers of toxic waste for future archaeologists to ponder. He shows that these materials must be considered alongside the often dangerous and exploitative labor processes that refine them into the devices underlying our seemingly virtual or immaterial practices. A Geology of Media demonstrates that the environment does not just surround our media cultural world-it runs through it, enables it, and hosts it in an era of unprecedented climate change. While looking backward to Earth's distant past, it also looks forward to a more expansive media theory-and, implicitly, media activism-to come.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Parikka","given":"Jussi"}],"call-number":"P 90 .P3355 2015eb, P 90 .P3355 2015","citation-key":"parikkaGeologyMedia2015","collection-title":"Electronic mediations ; v. 46","event-place":"Minneapolis ; London, Minneapolis","ISBN":"978-1-336-18615-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","publisher-place":"Minneapolis ; London, Minneapolis","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"A geology of media","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt13x1mnj"},

  {"id":"peterwadeRaceNatureCulture2015","abstract":"Since the controversial scientific race theories of the 1930s, anthropologists have generally avoided directly addressing the issue of race, viewing it as a social construct. Challenging this tradition, Peter Wade proposes in this volume that anthropologists can in fact play an important role in the study of race. Wade is critical of contemporary theoretical studies of race formulated within the contexts of colonial history, sociology and cultural studies. Instead he argues for a new direction; one which anthropology is well placed to explore. Taking the study of race beyond Western notions of the individual, Wade argues for new paradigms in social science, in particular in the development of connections between race, sex and gender. An understanding of these issues within an anthropological context, he contends, is vital for defining personhood and identity. Race is often defined by its reference to biology, ‘blood,’ genes, nature or essence. Yet these concepts are often left unexamined. Integrating material from the history of science, science studies, and anthropological studies of kinship and new reproductive technologies, as well as from studies of race, Peter Wade explores the meaning of such terms and interrogates the relationship between nature and culture in ideas about race.","author":[{"literal":"Peter Wade"}],"citation-key":"peterwadeRaceNatureCulture2015","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctt18fs6j5","ISBN":"978-0-7453-1454-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Pluto Press","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Race, Nature and Culture: An Anthropological Perspective","title-short":"Race, Nature and Culture","type":"book"},

It rescued ancient learning from obscurity, transformed knowledge of the natural and physical world, and brought the thrill of book ownership to the masses.

The Book in the Renaissance reconstructs the first 150 years of the world of print, exploring the complex web of religious, economic, and cultural concerns surrounding the printed word. From its very beginnings, the printed book had to straddle financial and religious imperatives, as well as the very different requirements and constraints of the many countries who embraced it, and, as Pettegree argues, the process was far from a runaway success. More than ideas, the success or failure of books depended upon patrons and markets, precarious strategies and the thwarting of piracy, and the ebb and flow of popular demand.

The complex social situation, the prolonged effect of the war, the continuing fiscal crisis, cumbersome administrative procedures, lack of political will and resistance from some conservatives, were factors that prevented the prompt and massive access to free life. Somehow, these early setbacks announced the slow development that characterized the process of manumission during Republican times.","author":[{"family":"Pico","given":"Roger Pita"}],"citation-key":"picoManumisionCostaCaribe2013","container-title":"Historia Caribe","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"es","page":"32","source":"Zotero","title":"La manumisión en la costa caribe colombiana durante el proceso de independencia: vicisitudes de una ilusión aplazada, 1810-1825","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"piterbergWakefieldMarxWorld2015","abstract":"This article focuses on Edward Gibbon Wakefield’s theory of colonization, on Karl Marx’s response to it, and on the role that settler colonialism as a global phenomenon played in shaping their thought. Marx’s rejoinder to Wakefield’s interpretation of an episode in the early colonization of Western Australia, when servants had deserted a wealthy colonist, was a foundational moment in the development of his general argument. Wakefield’s reaction to that episode was to develop the theory of ‘systematic colonization’, which he also proposed as an antidote to the prospect of impending revolution. Marx’s notion of primitive accumulation was entwined with his reading of Wakefield’s project. We argue that their different approaches to colonization, the prospect of settling ‘empty lands’ in other continents, can be seen as the starting points of two different political traditions. While revolutionary traditions are well known, this article outlines another global tradition, a political tradition that refuses reaction and revolution equally, and envisages displacement as the best method to produce social transformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Piterberg","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Veracini","given":"Lorenzo"}],"citation-key":"piterbergWakefieldMarxWorld2015","container-title":"Journal of Global History","DOI":"10.1017/S1740022815000224","ISSN":"1740-0228, 1740-0236","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11]]},"language":"en","page":"457-478","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Wakefield, Marx, and the world turned inside out","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/abs/wakefield-marx-and-the-world-turned-inside-out/06D47E493E7A567516881BCE91B7C481","volume":"10"},

In 1789, there was only one newspaper on the island, the officially licensed Affiches américaines, with two editions, one in the colony's capital, Port-au-Prince, and the other in its commercial center, Cap Français. By the time of the destruction of Cap Français, the colony's major city in June 1793, more than a dozen different newspapers had been founded in the colony, making it the second site in the New World, after Britain's North American colonies, to experience the phenomenon of a revolutionary press. Not only were there more newspapers, but their content and language were radically different from those of the Affiches. Like the newspapers created in France in 1789, those in Saint-Domingue denounced the vestiges of royal power and called on the colony's white citizens to demand the right to govern themselves. By helping to break down traditional authority, the press played an essential if unintentional role in making the revolts against white rule by Saint-Domingue's free people of color and its slave population possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Popkin","given":"Jeremy D."}],"citation-key":"popkinColonialMediaRevolution2018","container-title":"The Americas","DOI":"10.1017/tam.2017.95","ISSN":"0003-1615, 1533-6247","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3-25","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"A Colonial Media Revolution: The Press in Saint-Domingue, 1789–1793","title-short":"A Colonial Media Revolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/americas/article/colonial-media-revolution-the-press-in-saintdomingue-17891793/877FE79FDDA34D5B5F7022DCA5B32CC4","volume":"75"},

Under Indian Removal, they eventually ceded many of their lands, and most of the Potawatomi relocated to Nebraska, Kansas, and Indian Territory, now in Oklahoma.

Su presencia en el acontecer americano está signada por el amor, la pasión, el carácter, el desprecio al qué dirán, el valor y la resignación. Para ella los prejuicios no existieron. Por eso se emancipó cuando vio a Simón Bolívar, y lo amó y lo adoró hasta cuando entregó su vida al Creador.La época, la sociedad y el ambiente en el cual actuó lo formaba una burguesía que vivía de apariencias. Por eso transgredió cánones religiosos y sociales y su temple y su carácter no le permitieron ninguna rectificación. Dominó y esclavizó a quienes la rodeaban valiéndose de su belleza y de su femenil coquetería. &quot;Odió a sus enemigos y quiso a sus amigos&quot;. En Manuelita resplandecieron mil virtudes que la coronaron con títulos inmarcesibles: &quot;La amada in mortal&quot;. &quot;La Libertadora del Libertador&quot;.Manuelita siempre respetuosa y digna no vivió en la misma casa con el Libertador en ninguno de los países donde estuvieron, ni tampoco en las marchas de campaña. Sólo compartió la vivienda en la Quinta de Bogotá después del atentado septembrino, a petición expresa del Libertador, para cuidarlo y reanimarlo.Para Simón Bolívar, Manuelita fue al mismo tiempo amiga, amante, mujer, secretaria, escribiente, húsar, espía, enfermera, consejera, compañera, oficial de confianza, archivera, depositaría de documentos íntimos, defensora, inspiradora, promotora y confidente. O como bellamente lo escribiera la académica y poetisa Dora Castellanos, en su hermoso libro &quot;Un hombre diáfano, Simón Bolívar&quot;&quot;Ella fue, en materia de amor - pasión, la mujer más importante y significativa de su vida. Es a la única a quien llama, evoca e invoca no sólo siempre, sino cuando comienza a declinar su sol vital. Es a ella a quien clama con desesperación: &quot;Ven, ven pronto&quot; y ella es la que acude una y mil veces: aconseja, archiva, guarda y aguarda, espera y desespera, acompaña, entibia, cura, pone y dispone, lo exalta, lo encoleriza, lo apacigua y finalmente lo salva de ser asesinado&quot;.Sugestiva y cautivante la vida de Manuelita Sáenz, &quot;la primera feminista de América&quot;.

The Japanese silk paintings and screens of idealized landscapes were hardly distinguishable from their Chinese counterparts.

It is one of the earliest musical types used by the Greeks. The prosodion was accompanied by the aulos, whereas the associated paean (performed while standing) was accompanied by the kithara. Prosodia were composed by Alcman, Pindar, Simonides of Ceos, Bacchylides, Eumelus of Corinth, and Limenius (whose prosodion follows its paean, rather than preceding it), as well the various winners in art competitions (Mouseia). The etymology of the word is related to ὁδός hodos road and not with ᾠδή  ôidê song. According to Soterichus, the music of the prosodia by Alcman, Pindar, Simonides, and Bacchylides was written in the Dorian tonos \"because of its grandeur and dignity\".

  {"id":"proUtopiasLatinAmerica2018","abstract":"In an age in which fears about the future predominate (in the form of dystopias, ecological catastrophes and terrifying Sci-Fi scenarios), utopia is reappearing as the bearer of hope for the fate of humanity. Latin America has historically been a fertile ground where utopian projects, movements and experiments could take root and thrive, and this constitutes one of the region's major contributions to world history. Each of the thirteen authors who participate to this collective volume address a particular case or specific aspect of Latin American utopianism from colonial times to the present day. The relationship between utopia and America - Latin America in particular - has been a constant throughout the ages and helps to clarify both the concept of Utopia and of Latin America. The one cannot be understood without the other, from the book of Thomas More in 1516 to the present. Myths and legends of utopian content already proliferated at the time of the voyages of exploration, spurring on the conquistadors, while the knowledge gap about lands awaiting discovery was filled with stories about utopias. The America that the Spanish and Portuguese discovered became, from the sixteenth century onwards, a space in which it was possible to imagine the widest variety of forms of human coexistence. Utopias in Latin America reconsiders the sense and understanding of utopias in various historical frames: the discovery of indigenous cultures and their natural environments; the foundation of new towns and cities in a vast colonial territory considered as empty space in which it was possible to start afresh; the experimental communities of nineteenth-century utopian socialists and European exiled intellectuals; and the innovative formulae that attempts to get beyond twentieth-century capitalism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pro","given":"Juan"}],"citation-key":"proUtopiasLatinAmerica2018","event-place":"Portland, UNITED KINGDOM","ISBN":"978-1-78284-541-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"publisher":"Sussex Academic Press","publisher-place":"Portland, UNITED KINGDOM","source":"ProQuest Ebook Central","title":"Utopias in Latin America: Past and Present","title-short":"Utopias in Latin America","type":"book","URL":"http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ndlib-ebooks/detail.action?docID=5331306"},

  {"id":"racineMessageMassacreVenezuela2013","abstract":"During the ‘War to the Death’, which took place in Venezuela (and parts of modern-day Colombia) between 1813–1815, there was an extensive campaign of symbolic violence on both the patriot and royal sides, with various types of massacres being carried out against specific targets and by specific groups, with racialized or gendered overtones often laid over the more obvious political categories. For example, when American patriots captured royalist strongholds, European Spaniards (including elderly men) were hauled out of their homes, paraded around in feminizing poses, such as being placed side-saddle on mules, before they were executed. Similarly, royalist commanders ridiculed patriot women sympathizers as traitors to their God and King (not to mention their biology) and executed them in ways that aimed to restore the women's gender submission, which could include rape, hanging upside down to emphasize their genitalia, and ripping stomachs open to reveal (and simultaneously ruin) wombs. Both the royalist and patriot sides engaged in body-related communication through the sending of notes written in blood, the hanging of corpses in sacred places, the taking of ears and other body parts to be worn as part of a triumphant Indian-style war costume. Both sides courted the local slave population and incorporated imagined elements of African warfare to augment their message. Depending on the particular context, rumours of imagined African-style cannibalism were floated among populations to create fear and hostility. The essay will be based on eight years of archival research in Venezuela, Spain, Britain and the United States, along with contemporary memoirs, correspondence, newspaper accounts, travelogues, and the extensive secondary literature in English, Spanish, French and Portuguese.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Racine","given":"Karen"}],"citation-key":"racineMessageMassacreVenezuela2013","container-title":"Journal of Genocide Research","DOI":"10.1080/14623528.2013.789204","ISSN":"1462-3528","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,1]]},"page":"201-217","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Message by massacre: Venezuela's War to the Death, 1810–1814","title-short":"Message by massacre","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14623528.2013.789204","volume":"15"},

Eliot’s phrase, or “the most provincial of the arts,” according to W. H. Auden. But in<i>A Transnational Poetics,</i>Jahan Ramazani uncovers the ocean-straddling energies of the poetic imagination—in modernism and the Harlem Renaissance; in post–World War II North America and the North Atlantic; and in ethnic American, postcolonial, and black British writing. Cross-cultural exchange and influence are, he argues, among the chief engines of poetic development in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.<br> <br> Reexamining the work of a wide array of poets, from Eliot, Yeats, and Langston Hughes to Elizabeth Bishop, Lorna Goodison, and Agha Shahid Ali, Ramazani reveals the many ways in which modern and contemporary poetry in English overflows national borders and exceeds the scope of national literary paradigms. Through a variety of transnational templates—globalization, migration, travel, genre, influence, modernity, decolonization, and diaspora—he discovers poetic connection and dialogue across nations and even hemispheres.</p> \n</div> \n<br>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ramazani","given":"Jahan"}],"citation-key":"ramazaniTransnationalPoetics2015","ISBN":"978-0-226-70337-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,9,4]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"www-degruyter-com.proxy.library.nd.edu","title":"A Transnational Poetics","type":"book","URL":"https://www-degruyter-com.proxy.library.nd.edu/chicago/view/title/558714"},

Invaluable in its connection of African Diaspora Studies; Spanish and Portugese cultural studies; literary criticism and Latin American Literature to Caribbean studies generally, this collection will further enhance the link between African and the Americas. The book is divided into four parts, the first two focusing on a specific country in the Caribbean, Central and Latin America, Mexico and Equatorial Guinea. An overview of the black presence is discussed together with the historical, political and sociocultural issues that have emerged in each country.

Why were the most important Afro-descendant military leaders executed by the Creole forces? What was the fate of those soldiers and their descendants at the end of the war? This paper intends to answer these controversial questions, while explaining the main characteristics of society throughout the five countries freed by the Bolivarian armies in the 1810s and 1820s.

In Resource Radicals, Thea Riofrancos unpacks the conflict between these two leftisms: on the one hand, the administration's resource nationalism and focus on economic development; and on the other, the anti-extractivism of grassroots activists who condemned the disregard for nature and indigenous communities. In this archival and ethnographic study, Riofrancos expands the study of resource politics by decentering state resource policy and locating it in a field of political struggle populated by actors with conflicting visions of resource extraction. She demonstrates how Ecuador's commodity-dependent economy and history of indigenous uprisings offer a unique opportunity to understand development, democracy, and the ecological foundations of global capitalism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Riofrancos","given":"Thea"}],"call-number":"HD 9506 .E22 R56 2020","citation-key":"riofrancosResourceRadicalsPetroNationalism2020","collection-title":"Radical Américas","contributor":[{"literal":"Walter de Gruyter & Co"}],"event-place":"Durham","ISBN":"978-1-4780-1212-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"264","publisher":"Duke University Press","publisher-place":"Durham","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Resource Radicals: From Petro-Nationalism to Post-Extractivism in Ecuador","title-short":"Resource Radicals","type":"book","URL":"https://login.proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.degruyter.com/openurl?genre=book&isbn=9781478012122"},

For example, an individual's reduction in spending reduces the incomes of others and their ability to spend.In sociology, the ripple effect can be observed in how social interactions can affect situations not directly related to the initial interaction, and in charitable activities where information can be disseminated and passed from community to community to broaden its impact.The concept has been applied in computer science within the field of software metrics as a complexity measure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,16]]},"citation-key":"RippleEffect2020","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,25]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 980336983","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Ripple effect","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ripple_effect&oldid=980336983"},

Very few of these mercenaries came back. Many succumbed to tropical diseases or battles, and the remainder settled in the new states that they helped to create. This two-volume edition tells the little known story of these freedom mercenaries. Using historical evidence, this work offers a complete study of the struggle of both Britons and South Americans in these Wars of Independence and analyzes their actions in the larger context of the foreign policies of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Imperial Russia, and the German States. Each volume features self-contained, but complementary chapters that follow one major unit or volunteer.

The proposed synthesis of and also calls for a renewal of critical theory by making social scientists aware of their performative involvement in cosmopolitics.

Dating the onset of the Anthropocene is a political and ontological as much as a scientific act. This essay argues the Anthropocene is inexorably racial because it flows out of a capitalist system which requires racializing populations and environments from early modernity to the present and into the future. The essay contends that racial capitalism should be a central category in explaining the onset of the Anthropocene. The focus will be on investigating whether it makes sense to take the European discovery of the Americas and the genocide against its original inhabitants as threshold of a new geological epoch. Following the radicalization of Marx in the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari, it will be suggested that though colonization and slavery were essential for modern globalization to emerge, capital embarked on its self-perpetuating...","author":[{"family":"Saldanha","given":"Arun"}],"citation-key":"saldanhaDateDestinyRacial2020","container-title":"Environment and planning.

  {"id":"sanchezMiDelirioSobre2009","abstract":"The author studies the poem written by Bolívar in 1823. He claims that upon the overwhelming beauty of the volcano and in face of a complex and chaotic fate, the hero is submitted to timeless fears. His attempt to bond with earth’s elements and set himself anew in a world being redefined in battlefields, makes Serrano draw parallels with Christ’s Sermon on the Mount. Other biblical analogies are related to the voice of time, whom Bolívar speaks to on the Chimborazo’s summit. Serrano points out that the hero, disturbed by political events, is possessed by a “violent passion”, a political project that turns into the obsession of forging the greatness of a free nation. Serrano conceives the Elder’s voice (used in the poem to name time) as representing a perpetual mythical order (custodian of mineral and spiritual worlds) that questions the one who doubts, again, just as Christ does. The author believes the poem’s open ending suggests that it is only in dreams or delusion where we can acknowledge our condition of “miserable mortals”.","author":[{"family":"Sánchez","given":"Raúl Serrano"}],"citation-key":"sanchezMiDelirioSobre2009","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"es","page":"19","source":"Zotero","title":"“Mi delirio sobre el Chimborazo”: anuncios y fundación","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"santosEpistemologiesSouthJustice2014","abstract":"In a world of appalling social inequalities people are becoming more aware of the multiple dimensions of injustice, whether social, political, cultural, sexual, ethnic, religious, historical, or ecological. Rarely acknowledged is another vital dimension: cognitive injustice, the failure to recognize the different ways of knowing by which people across the globe run their lives and provide meaning to their existence. This book shows why cognitive injustice underlies all the other dimensions; global social justice is not possible without global cognitive justice. Santos s argument unfolds in two inquiries. No matter how internally diverse, Western Modernity provided the knowledge underlying the long cycle of colonialism followed by global capitalism. These historical processes profoundly devalued and marginalized the knowledge and wisdom that had been in existence in the global South. Today, working against epistemicide is imperative in order to recover and valorize the epistemological diversity of the world. Such recovery and valorization is the book s second inquiry and is based on four key analytical tools: sociology of absences, sociology of emergences, ecology of knowledges, and intercultural translation. The transformation of the world s epistemological diversity into an empowering instrument against hegemonic globalization points to a new kind of bottom-up cosmopolitanism. It would promote a wide conversation of humankind, celebrating conviviality, solidarity, and life against the logic of market-ridden greed and individualism and the destruction of life to which world populations large and small are condemned by the dominant forces of globalization. --Provided by publisher.","author":[{"family":"Santos","given":"Boaventura de Sousa"}],"call-number":"HM 651 .S2483 2014","citation-key":"santosEpistemologiesSouthJustice2014","event-place":"Boulder","ISBN":"978-1-61205-544-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Paradigm Publishers","publisher-place":"Boulder","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Epistemologies of the South: justice against epistemicide","title-short":"Epistemologies of the South","type":"book"},

  {"id":"saviglianoTangoPoliticalEconomy2018","abstract":"\"What is tango? Dance, music, and lyrics of course, but also a philosophy, a strategy, a commodity, even a disease. This book explores the politics of tango, tracing tango's travels from the brothels of Buenos Aires to the cabarets of Paris and the shako dansu clubs of Tokyo. The author is an Argentinean political theorist and a dance professor at the University of California at Riverside. She uses her?tango tongue? to tell interwoven tales of sexuality, gender, race, class, and national identity. Along the way she unravels relations between machismo and colonialism, postmodernism and patriarchy, exoticism and commodification. In the end she arrives at a discourse on decolonization as intellectual?unlearning.?Marta Savigliano's voice is highly personal and political. Her account is at once about the exoticization of tango and about her own fate as a Third World woman intellectual. A few sentences from the preface are indicative:?Tango is my womb and my tongue, a trench where I can shelter and resist the colonial invitations to '`'universalism, '? a stubborn fatalist mood when technocrats and theorists offer optimistic and seriously revised versions of '`'alternatives' for the Third World, an opportunistic metaphor to talk about myself and my stories as a success' of the civilization-development-colonization of Am?ca Latina, and a strategy to figure out through the history of the tango a hooked-up story of people like myself. Tango is my changing, resourceful source of identity. And because I am where I am?outside?tango hurts and comforts me: '`'Tango is a sad thought that can be danced.'?Savigliano employs the tools of ethnography, history, body-movement analysis, and political economy. Well illustrated with drawings and photos dating back to the 1880s, this book is highly readable, entertaining, and provocative. It is sure to be recognized as an important contribution in the fields of cultural studies, performance studies, decolonization, and women-of-color feminism.\"--Provided by publisher.","archive":"/z-wcorg/","author":[{"family":"Savigliano","given":"Marta","suffix":""}],"citation-key":"saviglianoTangoPoliticalEconomy2018","ISBN":"9780429497001 0429497008","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"English","source":"http://worldcat.org","title":"Tango And The Political Economy Of Passion","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780429497001"},

Crusoe is not a natural man but rather a social man in isolation, and makes his solitude an object of reflection. He therefore assists in the development of Emile's awareness of himself as an individual, which marks the transition between Emile's existence as a merely physical being and his existence as a moral being. Crusoe prepares Emile to address the question, \"What is society good for?\" by expanding Emile's understanding of what is good. The implications of these considerations for understanding Rousseau's ideas about authorship, identity, and the possibility of a truly self-sufficient individual are developed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Schaeffer","given":"Denise"}],"citation-key":"schaefferUtilityInkRousseau2002","container-title":"The Review of Politics","ISSN":"0034-6705","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"page":"121-148","publisher":"[University of Notre Dame du lac on behalf of Review of Politics, Cambridge University Press]","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Utility of Ink: Rousseau and Robinson Crusoe","title-short":"The Utility of Ink","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1408696","volume":"64"},

  {"id":"schroederHistoricizingMediaGlobalizing2019","abstract":"Visions of media spanning the globe and connecting cultures have been around at least since the birth of telegraphy, yet they have always fallen short of realities. Nevertheless, with the internet, a global infrastructure has emerged, which, together with mobile and smartphones, has rapidly changed the media landscape. This far-reaching digital connectedness makes it increasingly clear that the main implications of media lie in the extent to which they reach into everyday life. This article puts this reach into historical context, arguing that, in the pre-modern period, geographically extensive media networks only extended to a small elite. With the modern print revolution, media reach became both more extensive and more intensive. Yet it was only in the late nineteenth century that media infrastructures penetrated more widely into everyday life. Apart from a comparative historical perspective, several social science disciplines can be brought to bear in order to understand the ever more globalizing reach of media infrastructures into everyday life, including its limits. To date, the vast bulk of media research is still concentrated on North America and Europe. Recently, however, media research has begun to track broader theoretical debates in the social sciences, and imported debates about globalization from anthropology, sociology, political science, and international relations. These globalizing processes of the media research agenda have been shaped by both political developments and changes in media, including the Cold War, decolonization, the development of the internet and other new media technologies, and the rise of populist leaders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Schroeder","given":"Ralph"}],"citation-key":"schroederHistoricizingMediaGlobalizing2019","container-title":"Journal of Global History","DOI":"10.1017/S1740022819000202","ISSN":"1740-0228, 1740-0236","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11]]},"language":"en","page":"437-453","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Historicizing media, globalizing media research: infrastructures, publics, and everyday life","title-short":"Historicizing media, globalizing media research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/abs/historicizing-media-globalizing-media-research-infrastructures-publics-and-everyday-life/02075AFED3DC798F33E6FCD4206C8100","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"schulmanMediaNationPolitical2017","abstract":"From the creation of newspapers with national reach in the late nineteenth century to the lightning-fast dispatches and debates of today's Internet, the media have played an enormous role in modern American politics. Scholars of political history universally concede the importance of this relationship yet have devoted scant attention to its development during the past century. Even as mass media have largely replaced party organizations as the main vehicles through which politicians communicate with and mobilize citizens, little historical scholarship traces the institutional changes, political organizations, and media structures that underlay this momentous shift.With Media Nation, editors Bruce J. Schulman and Julian E. Zelizer seek to bring the media back to the center of scholarship on the history of the United States since the Progressive Era. The book's revealing case studies examine key moments and questions within the evolution of the media from the early days of print news through the era of television and the Internet, including battles over press freedom in the early twentieth century, the social and cultural history of news reporters at the height of the Cold War, and the U.S. government's abandonment of the Fairness Doctrine and the consequent impact on news production, among others.Although they cover a diverse array of subjects, the book's contributors cohere around several critical ideas, including how elites interact with media, how key policy changes shaped media, and how media institutions play an important role in shaping society's power structure. Highlighting some of the most exciting voices in media and political history, Media Nation is a field-shaping volume that offers fresh perspectives on the role of mass media in the evolution of modern American politics.Contributors: Kathryn Cramer Brownell, David Greenberg, Julia Guarneri, Nicole Hemmer, Richard R.

With the end of the Cold War, the opening of the Chinese economy, and the ascendancy of digital technology, the prospect of a unified flow of goods and services and of people and ideas seemed unstoppable. Yes, there were pockets of resistance and reaction, but these, we were told, would be swept away in a relentless tide of free markets and global integration that would bring Hollywood, digital fi nance, and fast food to all.Nonetheless, we have begun to experience the backlash against a global world founded on digital fungibility, and the perils of appeals to nationalism, identity, and authenticity have become only too apparent. The anxieties and resentments produced by this new world order among those left behind are oft en manifested in assertions of xenophobia and particularity. The “other” is coming to take what is ours, and we must defend ourselves!Digitalizing the Global Text is a collection of essays by an international group of scholars that situate themselves squarely at this nexus of forces.

  {"id":"shonheAdoptionFAIRData2021","abstract":"The main aim of this study was to explore the adoption and implementation of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) Data principles in academic libraries. To achieve this, the study analysed six different academic library websites and reports to determine how they have adopted and are implementing FAIR data principles, thereby providing benchmarks and guidance on emerging best practices for libraries in developing countries that are looking forward to implement such principles. This paper is also intended to help raise awareness of Fair Data Principles in academic libraries that seek to boost the visibility, interoperability and usability of the data and information in their repositories. Additionally, findings from this paper should provide a reference guide to various interlinked open access resources required by researchers to publish their research data. From the six case studies surveyed and compared in this paper, it was established that the universities had expended substantial efforts to establish crucial institutional infrastructures for adoption and implementation of FAIR data principles in the creation, management and facilitation of global visibility and access to their data resources. The paper recommends that for academic libraries to have a comprehensive and effective infrastructure for managing FAIR data they need to promote data champions and implement, institutional repositories, metadata standards, FAIR and open access policies, collaborative networks, data organization and management procedures, and data management plans.","author":[{"family":"Shonhe","given":"Liah"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Priti"}],"citation-key":"shonheAdoptionFAIRData2021","container-title":"Journal of Information Science","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"Adoption of FAIR Data Principles in Academic Libraries: Lessons from Practices of Some Universities in Europe and America","type":"article-journal"},

Focused on the Atlantic dimensions of Miranda’s activism, historians have marginalized his experiences in the Balkans. This article argues that Miranda’s Balkan explorations represented a major inflection point in his revolutionary career. By expanding his experience with consular networks, the Balkans allowed him to develop new revolutionary strategies for channelling his discontent with imperial rule. Rather than resorting to print, consulates enabled Miranda to build secret coalitions in his increasingly public confrontation with what he called imperial ‘despotism’, a type of imperial rule featuring burdensome impositions, limitations on freedom of movement, and ethnic or religious discrimination. By excavating the first Latin American revolutionary encounter with the Balkans and stressing the common forms of anti-imperial mobilization, the article charts a more expansive and inclusive ‘south-eastern’ framework for rethinking the global Age of Revolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Simeonov","given":"Simeon"}],"citation-key":"simeonovMirandaBalkansDecadentundefined/ed","container-title":"Journal of Global History","DOI":"10.1017/S1740022820000352","ISSN":"1740-0228, 1740-0236","issued":{"literal":"undefined/ed"},"language":"en","page":"1-20","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Miranda in the Balkans: decadent despotism, consulship, and the making of a south-eastern revolutionary in the Age of Revolution","title-short":"Miranda in the Balkans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/miranda-in-the-balkans-decadent-despotism-consulship-and-the-making-of-a-southeastern-revolutionary-in-the-age-of-revolution/AB4F1A16B24A0DA9B5072861C5E240E3"},

  {"id":"SimonBolivarBuckner2021","abstract":"Simon Bolivar Buckner ( SY-mən BOL-i-vər BUK-nər; April 1, 1823 – January 8, 1914) was an American soldier and politician who fought in the United States Army in the Mexican–American War and in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He later served as the 30th governor of Kentucky.\nAfter graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, Buckner became an instructor there. He took a hiatus from teaching to serve in the Mexican–American War, participating in many of the major battles of that conflict. He resigned from the army in 1855 to manage his father-in-law's real estate in Chicago, Illinois. He returned to his native state of Kentucky in 1857 and was appointed adjutant general by Governor Beriah Magoffin in 1861. In this position, he tried to enforce Kentucky's neutrality policy in the early days of the Civil War. When the state's neutrality was breached, Buckner accepted a commission in the Confederate Army after declining a similar commission to the Union Army. In 1862, he accepted Ulysses S. Grant's demand for an \"unconditional surrender\" at the Battle of Fort Donelson. He was the first Confederate general to surrender an army in the war. He spent five months as a prisoner of war. After his release, Buckner participated in Braxton Bragg's failed invasion of Kentucky and near the end of the war became chief of staff to Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department.\nIn the years following the war, Buckner became active in politics. He was elected governor of Kentucky in 1887. It was his second campaign for that office. His term was plagued by violent feuds in the eastern part of the state, including the Hatfield–McCoy feud and the Rowan County War. His administration was rocked by scandal when state treasurer James \"Honest Dick\" Tate absconded with $250,000 from the state's treasury. As governor, Buckner became known for vetoing special interest legislation. In the 1888 legislative session alone, he issued more vetoes than the previous ten governors combined. In 1895, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. The following year, he joined the National Democratic Party, or \"Gold Democrats\", who favored a gold standard policy over the Free Silver position of the mainline Democrats. He was the National Democratic Party’s candidate for vice President of the United States in the 1896 election, but polled just over one percent of the vote on a ticket with his running mate, ex-Union general John M. Palmer. He never again sought public office and died on January 8, 1914.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,27]]},"citation-key":"SimonBolivarBuckner2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,17]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1018409840","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Simon Bolivar Buckner","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Bolivar_Buckner&oldid=1018409840"},

Patriotic political theorists throughout the Americas offered analogous critiques of imperial rule, designed comparable constitutions, and expressed common ambitions for their new nations' future relations with one another and the rest of the world. This book adopts a hemispheric perspective on the revolutions that liberated the United States and Spanish America, offering a new interpretation of their most important political ideas. Simon argues that the many points of agreement among various revolutionary political theorists across the Americas can be attributed to the problems they encountered in common as Creoles - that is, as the descendants of European settlers born in the Americas. He illustrates this by comparing the political thought of three Creole revolutionaries: Alexander Hamilton of the United States, Simón Bolívar of Venezuela, and Lucas Alamán of Mexico.","author":[{"family":"Simon","given":"Joshua"}],"citation-key":"simonIdeologyCreoleRevolution2017","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"publisher":"Cambridge University Press","title":"The Ideology of Creole Revolution : Imperialism and Independence in American and Latin American Political Thought","type":"book"},

With this, several shifts have occurred: the focus of labor has moved from production to consumption, the commodity has become the historical subject, and symbols now behave like materials.Neomaterialism explores the meaning of the world of commodities, and reintroduces various notions of dialectical materialism into the conversation on the subjectivity and vitalism of things. Here, Simon advocates for the unreadymade, sentimental value, and the promise of the dividual as a means for a vocabulary in this new economy of meaning.Reflecting on general intellect as labor and the subjugation of an overqualified generation to the neofeudal order of debt finance―with a particular focus on dispossession and rent economy, post-appropriation display strategies and negation, the barricade and capital's technocratic fascisms―Neomaterialism merges traditions of epic communism with the communism that is already here.","author":[{"family":"Simon","given":"Joshua"}],"citation-key":"simonNeomaterialism2013","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,9,6]]},"source":"Amazon","title":"Neomaterialism","type":"book"},

  {"id":"SoftwareBug2020","abstract":"A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The process of finding and fixing bugs is termed \"debugging\" and often uses formal techniques or tools to pinpoint bugs, and since the 1950s, some computer systems have been designed to also deter, detect or auto-correct various computer bugs during operations.\nMost bugs arise from mistakes and errors made in either a program's design or its source code, or in components and operating systems used by such programs. A few are caused by compilers producing incorrect code. A program that contains many bugs, and/or bugs that seriously interfere with its functionality, is said to be buggy (defective). Bugs can trigger errors that may have ripple effects. Bugs may have subtle effects or cause the program to crash or freeze the computer. Other bugs qualify as security bugs and might, for example, enable a malicious user to bypass access controls in order to obtain unauthorized privileges.\nSome software bugs have been linked to disasters. Bugs in code that controlled the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine were directly responsible for patient deaths in the 1980s. In 1996, the European Space Agency's US$1 billion prototype Ariane 5 rocket had to be destroyed less than a minute after launch due to a bug in the on-board guidance computer program. In June 1994, a Royal Air Force Chinook helicopter crashed into the Mull of Kintyre, killing 29. This was initially dismissed as pilot error, but an investigation by Computer Weekly convinced a House of Lords inquiry that it may have been caused by a software bug in the aircraft's engine-control computer.In 2002, a study commissioned by the US Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded that \"software bugs, or errors, are so prevalent and so detrimental that they cost the US economy an estimated $59 billion annually, or about 0.6 percent of the gross domestic product\".","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,16]]},"citation-key":"SoftwareBug2020","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,9]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 987802398","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Software bug","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Software_bug&oldid=987802398"},

  {"id":"sorensenModernistExperimentsGenre2017","abstract":"The years from 1890 through 1935 witnessed an explosion of print, both in terms of the variety of venues for publication and in the vast circulation figures and the quantity of print forums. Arguing that the formal strategies of modernist texts can only be fully understood in the context of the material forms and circuits of print culture through which they were produced and distributed, Jennifer Sorensen shows how authors and publishers conceptualized the material text as an object, as a body, and as an ontological problem. She examines works by Henry James, Jean Toomer, Djuna Barnes, Katherine Mansfield, and Virginia Woolf, showing that they understood acts of reading as materially mediated encounters. Sorensen draws on recent textual theory, media theory, archival materials, and paratexts such as advertisements, illustrations, book designs, drafts, diaries, dust jackets, notes, and frontispieces, to demonstrate how these writers radically redefined literary genres and refashioned the material forms through which their literary experiments reached the public. Placing the literary text at the center of inquiry while simultaneously expanding the boundaries of what counts as that, Sorensen shows that modernist generic and formal experimentation was deeply engaged with specific print histories that generated competitive media ecologies of competition and hybridization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Sorensen","given":"Jennifer J."}],"call-number":"Z 480 .L58 S57 2017","citation-key":"sorensenModernistExperimentsGenre2017","collection-title":"Studies in publishing history","contributor":[{"literal":"Routledge"}],"event-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","ISBN":"978-1-317-09454-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Modernist experiments in genre, media, and transatlantic print culture","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315595931"},
  {"id":"sorianoPublicSpherePrinting2020","abstract":"At the end of the eighteenth century, members of the colonial elite of the Captaincy General of Venezuela addressed a letter to the king of Spain in which they sought permission to have a printing press in the city of Caracas. In the letter, they argued that the establishment of such a press was fundamental for the economic and commercial development of the Captaincy. Months later, they learned that the permission for a printing press had been denied without further explanations. Venezuela became one of the last capital cities in colonial Spanish America to possess this technology. The lack of a printing press during this politically dynamic period moved by the Atlantic revolutions did not necessarily affect public access to reading, sharing of information, and political debate in Venezuela. Venezuela's unique geographical location, and its open and frequent connections with the Caribbean region during the Age of Revolutions allowed for the effective entrance and transit of people and written materials that spread revolutionary ideas and impressions, creating a dynamic and contested political environment. Here I argue that during the late-colonial period, semiliterate forms of knowledge transmission, partially promoted by Spanish reformism, mobilised a socially diverse public that openly debated the monarchical regime, the system of slavery, and the hierarchical socio-racial order of colonial society. The colonial public sphere in Venezuela was shaped, then, within a context of emerging socio-racial tensions and became a space of contestation and struggle, animated by the overlapping of contradictory political discourses. This study contributes to recent debates about the character, nature, and relevance of the public sphere in the colonial world. It explores the circulation of manuscripts and ephemeral written materials, the different modes of production and reception of texts that developed in the colonial context, and an analysis of the character of the urban spaces that facilitated the performativity of texts. It thus offers a new framework for understanding the emergence of a public sphere in Venezuela, a colonial peripheral province with no printing press.","author":[{"family":"Soriano","given":"Cristina"}],"citation-key":"sorianoPublicSpherePrinting2020","container-title":"Itinerario","contributor":[{"family":"Hunter","given":"Emma"},{"family":"James","given":"Leslie"}],"DOI":"10.1017/S0165115320000200","event-place":"Cambridge, UK","ISSN":"0165-1153","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"eng","page":"341–364","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, UK","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Public Sphere without a Printing Press: Texts, Reading Networks, and Public Opinion in Venezuela during the Age of Revolutions","title-short":"Public Sphere without a Printing Press","type":"article-journal","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"sorianoTidesRevolutionInformation2018","abstract":"\"This is a book about the links between politics and literacy, and about how radical ideas spread in a world without printing presses. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Spanish colonial governments tried to keep revolution out of their provinces. But, as Cristina Soriano shows, hand-copied samizdat materials from the Caribbean flooded the cities and ports of Venezuela, hundreds of foreigners shared news of the French and Haitian revolutions with locals, and Venezuelans of diverse social backgrounds met to read hard-to-come-by texts and to discuss the ideas they expounded. These networks efficiently spread antimonarchical propaganda and abolitionist and egalitarian ideas, allowing Venezuelans to participate in an incipient yet vibrant public sphere and to contemplate new political scenarios. This book offers an in-depth analysis of one of the crucial processes that allowed Venezuela to become one of the first regions in Spanish America to declare independence from Iberia and turn into an influential force for South American independence. \"--","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Soriano","given":"Cristina"}],"citation-key":"sorianoTidesRevolutionInformation2018","event-place":"Albuquerque","ISBN":"978-0-8263-5985-8 978-0-8263-5986-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1264422631","publisher":"University of New Mexico Press","publisher-place":"Albuquerque","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Tides of Revolution Information, Insurgencies, and the Crisis of Colonial Rule in Venezuela","type":"book","URL":"https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/canterbury/detail.action?docID=5528404"},

It was minted in the Spanish Empire following a monetary reform in 1497 with content 25.563 g = 0.822 oz t fine silver. It was widely used as the first international currency because of its uniformity in standard and milling characteristics. Some countries countermarked the Spanish dollar so it could be used as their local currency.Because the Spanish dollar was widely used in Europe, the Americas, and the Far East, it became the first world currency by the late 18th century.The Spanish dollar was the coin upon which the original United States dollar was based (at 0.7735 oz t = 24.0566 g), and it remained legal tender in the United States until the Coinage Act of 1857. Many other currencies around the world, such as the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan, were initially based on the Spanish dollar and other 8-real coins. Diverse theories link the origin of the \"$\" symbol to the columns and stripes that appear on one side of the Spanish dollar.The term peso was used in Spanish to refer to this denomination, and it became the basis for many of the currencies in the former Spanish colonies, including the Argentine, Bolivian, Chilean, Colombian, Costa Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Ecuadorian, Guatemalan, Honduran, Mexican, Nicaraguan, Paraguayan, Philippine, Puerto Rican, Peruvian, Salvadoran, Uruguayan, and Venezuelan pesos.

Objecting to Diderot’s view, Rousseau’s article ‘Economy’ traces the origin of social and political obligation in the social contract. The reciprocal duties of equals are not associated to what we owe to the ‘human race’ but rather to what we owe to the political body under the aegis of the ‘general will.’ Diderot also became Rousseau’s main target in Chapter 2 of Book I of the Geneva Manuscript. Where Diderot seemed to naturalize the theory of social instinct developed by Shaftesbury, Rousseau actually returned to Hobbes: to him, the absence of a natural society of the human race condemned Diderot’s theory to inconsistency. Finally, neither materialism nor atheism suffice to understand the order of nature. In the ‘Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar,’ Rousseau describes as absurd the refusal to call for an organizing intelligence, or to deny the immortality of the soul and the existence of a free will.","author":[{"family":"Spector","given":"Céline"}],"citation-key":"spectorRousseauDiderotMaterialism2019","container-title":"The Rousseauian Mind","contributor":[{"family":"Kelly","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Grace","given":"Eve"}],"DOI":"10.4324/9780429020773-11","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-1-138-20531-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"eng","page":"107–118","publisher":"Routledge","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Rousseau and Diderot: Materialism and its discontents","title-short":"Rousseau and Diderot","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"steffenAnthropoceneGlobalChange2011","abstract":"Over the past century, the total material wealth of humanity has been enhanced. However, in the twenty-first century, we face scarcity in critical resources, the degradation of ecosystem services, and the erosion of the planet’s capability to absorb our wastes. Equity issues remain stubbornly difficult to solve. This situation is novel in its speed, its global scale and its threat to the resilience of the Earth System. The advent of the Anthropence, the time interval in which human activities now rival global geophysical processes, suggests that we need to fundamentally alter our relationship with the planet we inhabit. Many approaches could be adopted, ranging from geo-engineering solutions that purposefully manipulate parts of the Earth System to becoming active stewards of our own life support system. The Anthropocene is a reminder that the Holocene, during which complex human societies have developed, has been a stable, accommodating environment and is the only state of the Earth System that we know for sure can support contemporary society. The need to achieve effective planetary stewardship is urgent. As we go further into the Anthropocene, we risk driving the Earth System onto a trajectory toward more hostile states from which we cannot easily return.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Steffen","given":"Will"},{"family":"Persson","given":"Åsa"},{"family":"Deutsch","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Zalasiewicz","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Crumley","given":"Carole"},{"family":"Crutzen","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Folke","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Line"},{"family":"Molina","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Ramanathan","given":"Veerabhadran"},{"family":"Rockström","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Scheffer","given":"Marten"},{"family":"Schellnhuber","given":"Hans Joachim"},{"family":"Svedin","given":"Uno"}],"citation-key":"steffenAnthropoceneGlobalChange2011","container-title":"AMBIO","container-title-short":"AMBIO","DOI":"10.1007/s13280-011-0185-x","ISSN":"1654-7209","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,10,12]]},"language":"en","page":"739","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Anthropocene: From Global Change to Planetary Stewardship","title-short":"The Anthropocene","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-011-0185-x","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"strattonZombieTroubleZombie2011","abstract":"There has been a recent upsurge in texts featuring zombies. At the same time, members of western countries have become increasingly anxious about displaced peoples: asylum-seekers and other so-called illegal migrants who attempt to enter those countries. What displaced people, people without the protection of the state and zombies have in common is that both manifest the quality of what Giorgio Agamben calls ‘bare life’. Moreover, zombies have the qualities of workers or slaves driven to total exhaustion. The genre of the zombie apocalypse centres on laying siege to a place that is identified as a refuge for a group of humans. In these texts it is possible to read an equation of zombies with displaced people who are ‘threatening’ the state. Indeed, the rhetoric used to describe these people constructs them as similar to mythical zombies. This article includes analyses of a number of zombie films including Shaun of the Dead, Fido and Undead.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Stratton","given":"Jon"}],"citation-key":"strattonZombieTroubleZombie2011","container-title":"European Journal of Cultural Studies","DOI":"10.1177/1367549411400103","ISSN":"1367-5494, 1460-3551","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,6]]},"language":"en","page":"265-281","source":"Crossref","title":"Zombie trouble: Zombie texts, bare life and displaced people","title-short":"Zombie trouble","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1367549411400103","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"takashimaBenthamTheoryLanguage2019","abstract":"This paper has three tasks. First, I offer an interpretation of Jeremy Bentham’s theory of language which I hope can conciliate or integrate the three rival interpretations of its epistemological implication: reductionist realist, pragmatist, and fictionalist. It is accompanied by an interpretation of Bentham’s strategy for improving the state of language (especially concerning names of fictitious entities), which characterizes it as a “two-level” strategy. Second, by focusing on the linguistic thoughts of three philosophers, Locke, Condillac, and Tooke, I inquire into the sources of Bentham’s theory of language, and then try to evaluate the originality of Bentham’s theory in the context of the empiricist tradition of linguistic thought of the age of the Enlightenment. The inquiry also enables us to understand how Bentham’s theory came to have such a complex structure as is revealed in the first part of this paper. Third, I ask the question as to why Bentham, after about a thirty-year hiatus, suddenly resumed writing on the problems of language and logic around 1811. Through exhibiting the outline of my answer to this question, I argue that his discovery of “delusion” led him to fight the “war of words” in various fields of society, and his awareness of the strong force of delusion for aggravating the state of language made him realize the urgent necessity to develop at length “an entirely new system of Logic, in which shall be comprehended a theory of language, considered in the most general point of view.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Takashima","given":"Kazuya"}],"citation-key":"takashimaBenthamTheoryLanguage2019","container-title":"Revue d’études benthamiennes","DOI":"10.4000/etudes-benthamiennes.5856","ISSN":"1760-7507","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,15]]},"language":"en","license":"Droits réservés","number":"16","publisher":"Centre Bentham","source":"journals.openedition.org","title":"Bentham’s Theory of Language.

  {"id":"tardieuPrintingDeclaration2016","abstract":"While the Age of Revolution has long been associated with the French and American Revolutions, increasing attention is being paid to the Haitian Revolution as the third great event in the making of the modern world. A product of the only successful slave revolution in history, Haiti's Declaration of Independence in 1804 stands at a major turning point in the trajectory of social, economic, and political relations in the modern world. This declaration created the second independent country in the Americas and certified a new genre of political writing. Despite Haiti's global significance, however, scholars are only now beginning to understand the context, content, and implications of the Haitian Declaration of Independence.\nThis collection represents the first in-depth, interdisciplinary, and integrated analysis by American, British, and Haitian scholars of the creation and dissemination of the document, its content and reception, and its legacy. Throughout, the contributors use newly discovered archival materials and innovative research methods to reframe the importance of Haiti within the Age of Revolution and to reinterpret the declaration as a founding document of the nineteenth-century Atlantic World.\nThe authors offer new research about the key figures involved in the writing and styling of the document, its publication and dissemination, the significance of the declaration in the creation of a new nation-state, and its implications for neighboring islands. The contributors also use diverse sources to understand the lasting impact of the declaration on the country more broadly, its annual celebration and importance in the formation of a national identity, and its memory and celebration in Haitian Vodou song and ceremony. Taken together, these essays offer a clearer and more thorough understanding of the intricacies and complexities of the world's second declaration of independence to create a lasting nation-state.","author":[{"family":"Tardieu","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"tardieuPrintingDeclaration2016","collection-title":"Jeffersonian America","container-title":"The Haitian Declaration of Independence: Creation, Context, and Legacy","event-place":"Charlottesville","ISBN":"978-0-8139-3787-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of Virginia Press","publisher-place":"Charlottesville","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"The printing of the Declaration","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"thomassonSwedenHaiti179118252018","abstract":"The Haitian Revolution was followed with great interest in Stockholm during the first years of the nineteenth century. One might imagine that a Scandinavian country on the periphery of Europe would have been uninterested in, and removed from, events in the Caribbean. This was not the case. From 1802 to 1804, one Stockholm newspaper reported 276 times on the revolution and mentioned Toussaint Louverture's name 178 times.\nSwedish interest in Haiti was not limited to reporting about the revolution. Sweden tried in several ways to increase its trade with the new nation, and both Swedish and French merchants traded unofficially with independent Haiti under the Swedish flag. The Swedish government attempted to sell arms to both northern and southern Haiti in the 1810s using its Caribbean colony Saint-Barthélemy as an outpost. The Swedish case is another confirmation of recent studies rejecting the narrative of post-independence Haitian isolation.Swedish trade is an enlightening example of how smaller colonial powers tried to carve out a position in the highly competitive trade with Haiti and the nascent Latin American polities during and after the Napoleonic wars.\nSeveral Swedes visited Haiti in the 1810s-both in government service and as travelers-and wrote detailed accounts. An especially interesting document by a Swedish officer in Henry Christophe's army offers new information on the final stages of his reign in 1820.\nThe Haitian Revolution has been studied exhaustively during the past two decades. The oblivion that Michel-Rolph Trouillot eloquently exposed in the 1990s has been transformed into a stream of academic publications. The present article adds to this knowledge by analyzing Swedish perceptions of and contact with Haiti before the Swedish recognition of the Haitian nation in 1825. It also presents a range of new sources pertinent to independent Haiti's early history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomasson","given":"Fredrik"}],"citation-key":"thomassonSwedenHaiti179118252018","container-title":"Journal of Haitian Studies","event-place":"Santa Barbara, United States","ISSN":"10903488","issue":"2","issued":{"season":3,"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"English","license":"Copyright Journal of Haitian Studies Fall 2018","number-of-pages":"4-35","page":"4-35","publisher":"Journal of Haitian Studies","publisher-place":"Santa Barbara, United States","source":"ProQuest","title":"Sweden and Haiti, 1791-1825: Revolutionary Reporting, Trade, and the Fall of Henry Christophe","title-short":"Sweden and Haiti, 1791-1825","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2186664740/abstract/DAA18A2B82444E1FPQ/1","volume":"24"},

The First Wave of Decolonization is the first volume in any language to describe and analyze the scope and meanings of decolonization during this formative period. It demonstrates that the pioneers of decolonization were not twentieth-century Frenchmen or Algerians but nineteenth-century Peruvians and Colombians. In doing so, it vastly expands the horizons of decolonization, conventionally understood to be a post-war development emanating from Europe.

  {"id":"TreatyGuadalupeHidalgo2021","abstract":"The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (Spanish: Tratado de Guadalupe Hidalgo), officially titled the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, Limits and Settlement between the United States of America and the Mexican Republic, is the peace treaty that was signed on 2 February 1848, in the Villa de Guadalupe Hidalgo (now a neighborhood of Mexico City) between the United States and Mexico that ended the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). The treaty was ratified by the United States on 10 March and by Mexico on 19 May. The ratifications were exchanged on 30 May, and the treaty was proclaimed on 4 July 1848.With the defeat of its army and the fall of its capital in September 1847, Mexico entered into negotiations with the U.S. peace envoy, Nicholas Trist, to end the war. On the Mexican side, there were factions that did not concede defeat or seek to engage in negotiations. The treaty called for the United States to pay US$15 million to Mexico and to pay off the claims of American citizens against Mexico up to US$5 million. It gave the United States the Rio Grande as a boundary for Texas, and gave the U.S. ownership of California and a large area comprising roughly half of New Mexico, most of Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Colorado. Mexicans in those annexed areas had the choice of relocating to within Mexico's new boundaries or receiving American citizenship with full civil rights.\nThe U.S. Senate advised and consented to ratification of the treaty by a vote of 38–14.  The opponents of this treaty were led by the Whigs, who had opposed the war and rejected manifest destiny in general, and rejected this expansion in particular. The amount of land gained by the United States from Mexico was further increased as a result of the Gadsden Purchase of 1853, which ceded parts of present-day southern Arizona and New Mexico to the United States.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,5]]},"citation-key":"TreatyGuadalupeHidalgo2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1024985490","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo&oldid=1024985490"},

  {"id":"treschRomanticMachineUtopian2012","abstract":"\"In the years immediately following Napoleon's defeat, French thinkers in all fields set their minds to the problem of how to recover from the long upheavals that had been set into motion by the French Revolution. Many challenged the Enlightenment's emphasis on mechanics and questioned the rising power of machines, seeking a return to the organic unity of an earlier age and triggering the artistic and philosophical movement of romanticism. Previous scholars have viewed romanticism and industrialization in opposition, but in this groundbreaking volume John Tresch reveals how thoroughly entwined science and the arts were in early nineteenth-century France and how they worked together to unite a fractured society. Focusing on a set of celebrated technologies, including steam engines, electromagnetic and geophysical instruments, early photography, and mass-scale printing, Tresch looks at how new conceptions of energy, instrumentality, and association fueled such diverse developments as fantastic literature, popular astronomy, grand opera, positivism, utopian socialism, and the Revolution of 1848. He shows that those who attempted to fuse organicism and mechanism in various ways, including Alexander von Humboldt and Auguste Comte, charted a road not taken that resonates today. Essential reading for historians of science, intellectual and cultural historians of Europe, and literary and art historians, The Romantic Machine is poised to profoundly alter our understanding of the scientific and cultural landscape of the early nineteenth century.\"--Provided by publisher.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Tresch","given":"John"}],"call-number":"T 26 .F8 T74 2012eb, T 26 .F8 T74 2012","citation-key":"treschRomanticMachineUtopian2012","contributor":[{"literal":"Walter de Gruyter & Co"}],"event-place":"Chicago, Chicago ; London","ISBN":"978-0-226-81222-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of Chicago Press, The University of Chicago Press","publisher-place":"Chicago, Chicago ; London","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"The romantic machine: utopian science and technology after Napoleon","title-short":"The romantic machine","type":"book"},

  {"id":"trottFragmentMachinesScience2017","abstract":"This paper interrogates the ‘Fragment on Machines’ in Marx’s Grundrisse, first widely translated and disseminated in the 1960s at the dawn of post-Fordism. It examines its reception, and its deployment by the Italian Marxian tradition of Operaismo, and the criticisms this has sometimes garnered from other Marxists. I argue that while the ‘Fragment’ has generally been critically evaluated in terms of its contribution to the ‘scientific’ (or wissenschaftlich) critique of political economy—revealing truth through a method seen as objective, rational and methodical—it is in fact better understood in terms of its function as science fiction. In other words, its function as a piece of social commentary and criticism, exploring the social relations caught up with techno-scientific developments that are evidently already imaginable—revealing something about the then present, its dystopian dangers and utopian possibilities—even where these remained (just) beyond the realm of the scientifically possible. I argue that evaluating the ‘Fragment’ as science fiction draws attention to its effects, namely its capacity to pose (on the basis of this scientifically plausible interrogation of emergent futures) important political questions. Foremost among these was the meaning—for our understanding of the possible locations of workers’ resistance—of capital’s increasing reliance on relationships, forms of knowledge and affects that cannot be contained by the times and places of work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Trott","given":"Ben"}],"citation-key":"trottFragmentMachinesScience2017","container-title":"Cambridge Journal of Economics","DOI":"10.1093/cje/bex079","ISSN":"0309-166X, 1464-3545","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,25]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The ‘Fragment on Machines’ as science fiction; or, reading the Grundrisse politically","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://academic.oup.com/cje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cje/bex079/4774592"},

Both the popular rebellions prior to and the plots following the French Revolution were compounded by an increasing “public” awareness and discussion of politics and modern ideas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Uribe-Uran","given":"Victor M."}],"citation-key":"uribe-uranBirthPublicSphere2000","container-title":"Comparative Studies in Society and History","DOI":"10.1017/S0010417500002528","ISSN":"1475-2999, 0010-4175","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,4]]},"language":"en","page":"425-457","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"The Birth of a Public Sphere in Latin America During the Age of Revolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/comparative-studies-in-society-and-history/article/birth-of-a-public-sphere-in-latin-america-during-the-age-of-revolution/2D7856B118D94BEF6B2D8EECBC3ED83D","volume":"42"},

Examining liberal claims and searching for cohesion, he continuously weighs the reality of the continent against the image it projects, and considers the political dangers and possibilities that face this diverse set of countries. Now this illuminating and versatile collection assembles these never-before-translated criticisms and meditations. Reflecting the intellectual development of the writer himself, these essays distill the great events of Latin America's recent history, analyze political groups like FARC and Sendero Luminoso, and evaluate the legacies of infamous leaders such as Papa Doc Duvalier and Fidel Castro. Arranged by theme, they trace Vargas Llosa's unwavering demand for freedom, his embrace of and disenchantment with revolutions, and his critique of nationalism, populism, indigenism, and corruption. From the discovery of liberal ideas to a defense of democracy, buoyed by a passionate invocation of Latin American literature and art, Sabers and Utopias is a monumental collection from one of our most important writers. Uncompromising and adamantly optimistic, these social and political essays are a paean to thoughtful engagement and a brave indictment of the discrimination and fear that can divide a society..\"--Jacket flap.","author":[{"family":"Vargas Llosa","given":"Mario"}],"call-number":"F 1414.2 .V394513 2018","citation-key":"vargasllosaSabersUtopiasVisions2018","contributor":[{"family":"Kushner","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Granés","given":"Carlos"}],"edition":"First American edition..","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-374-25373-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","publisher-place":"New York","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Sabers and utopias: visions of Latin America","title-short":"Sabers and utopias","type":"book"},

The essay connects Rodr´ıguez’s corporeal take on typographic innovations (which he termed “the art of painting words”) with his postcolonial rendition of Western republicanism (which he called the “the art of painting republics”). It argues that Rodr´ıguez’s use of the term “gesture” served to create an experimental and performatic space for printing innovations and republican reforms, so as to imagine the post-Independence period as a new political beginning for Spanish American societies. The article reads Rodr´ıguez’s texts and a rich collection of 19th-century pieces about writing reforms, typographic aesthetics, and republicanism through the lens of Giorgio Agamben’s theorization of the “gesture” as an open-ended mediality. “Gesture,” as conceptualized by Rodr´ıguez and elucidated by Agamben, functions as a critical tool for proposing new connections between typography, education, and politics, and for highlighting the embodied dimension of Rodr´ıguez’s work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Velayos","given":"Emmanuel"}],"citation-key":"velayosPaintingWordsDrawing2019","container-title":"Hispanic Review","container-title-short":"Hispanic Review","DOI":"10.1353/hir.2019.0008","ISSN":"1553-0639","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"133-158","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Painting Words, Drawing Republics: Embodied Arts and New Beginnings in Simón Rodríguez","title-short":"Painting Words, Drawing Republics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/722840","volume":"87"},

  {"id":"vieiraDecolonialSubjectProblem2019","abstract":"It is argued in this paper that some decolonising strategies in the study of global politics are precluded by the problem of non-Western authenticity. I question the idea of an identifiable non-Western geo-cultural context that could significantly reconstitute what already is a post-Western subject. I claim that in most cases the asymmetrical encounter between the colonised and the coloniser has fundamentally and extensively redefined human subjectivity in a way that largely negates decolonial emancipatory projects. This is the result of the all-encompassing penetration of Western coloniality (in its political, economic and cultural representations) into the spaces of pre-colonial or uncolonised forms of subjectivity. I draw from Frantz Fanon’s and Jacques Lacan’s theories to argue that attempts to recover non-Western forms of self-identification are useful albeit illusory psychological mechanisms to stabilise hybrid postcolonial subjectivities rather than an actual restoration of non-colonial and purified forms of existing in the world. I suggest that an effective anticolonial politics of resistance will necessarily entail the understanding of post-Western subjectivity in terms of psychological ‘hybridity’ rather than decolonial ‘authenticity’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Vieira","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"vieiraDecolonialSubjectProblem2019","container-title":"Postcolonial Studies","DOI":"10.1080/13688790.2019.1608795","ISSN":"1368-8790","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,3]]},"page":"150-167","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The decolonial subject and the problem of non-Western authenticity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13688790.2019.1608795","volume":"22"},

Close to technicians and journalists of early film, Mallarmé developed what might be called a cinepoetics, especially in Un coup de dés (1897)-the ur-modernist visual poem whose preface recoups the single declaration he made on cinema-and in the unrealized project known as Le Livre (1893-98), a poetic performance involving electrical lighting and image projection. Close readings make explicit Mallarmé's cinepoetic aesthetics. Its epistemology of déroulement 'unfolding' is compared with that of other 1890s figures: Étienne-Jules Marey, Henri Bergson, and Loïe Fuller. Cinepoetry has not been recognized as the distinct practice it was, although Walter Benjamin and Jacques Derrida came close to theorizing Mallarmé's interest in cinema. Cinepoetic experimentation has shadowed the whole French vanguard. The study of its genealogy should reshape our understanding of the intersection of modernist lyricism and new media.","author":[{"family":"Wall-Romana","given":"Christophe"}],"citation-key":"wall-romanaMallarmeCinepoeticsPoem2005","container-title":"PMLA","ISSN":"0030-8129","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"language":"eng","page":"128–147","publisher":"Modern Language Association of America","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Mallarmé's Cinepoetics: The Poem Uncoiled by the Cinématographe, 1893-98","title-short":"Mallarmé's Cinepoetics","type":"article-journal","volume":"120"},

Latour formulates this concept in explicating how modernist scientific and political institutions require a metaphysical foundation that is anti-democratic in rigidly partitioning nature from society. In the stead of nature/society, Latour proposes a ‘cosmopolitics’ in which we recognize our embroilment in systems comprised of heterogeneous human and nonhuman actors, and seek to innovate appropriate procedures for governing such systems and composing a more peaceful common world. However, feminist and postcolonialist science studies scholars have argued that Latour’s project fails to apprehend the experiences of subjects marginalized by scientific and political structures of representation.

Hearing their grievances against white overseers and settlers who stole their wood, he helped organize what was called the Mashpee Revolt of 1833-34. Their attempt to regain civil rights was covered sympathetically by the Boston Advocate, but criticized by local journals on Cape Cod. Apess published a book about the experience in 1835, which he summarized as \"Indian Nullification.\"\nApess alienated many of his supporters before dying in New York City at age 41, but he has been described as \"perhaps the most successful activist on behalf of Native American rights in the antebellum United States.\"","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"citation-key":"WilliamApess2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,14]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1012113197","source":"Wikipedia","title":"William Apess","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Apess&oldid=1012113197"},
  {"id":"WilliamBlake2022","abstract":"William Blake (28 November 1757 – 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his \"prophetic works\" were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form \"what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language\". His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him \"far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced\". In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham, he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the imagination as \"the body of God\" or \"human existence itself\".Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as \"Pre-Romantic\". In fact, he has been said to be \"a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism\". A committed Christian who was hostile to the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions.  Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such as Emanuel Swedenborg. Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes him difficult to classify. The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised him as a \"glorious luminary\", and \"a man not forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable successors\".","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,10]]},"citation-key":"WilliamBlake2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,10]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1126560941","source":"Wikipedia","title":"William Blake","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Blake&oldid=1126560941#cite_ref-115"},

How did it happen? What did the process of the 'end of empire' look like? Empire's End considers the nation's imperial legacy beyond this period, all the way up to the present moment. In addition to scrutinizing the political, economic, and social implications of this 'end,' these chapters emphasize the cultural impact of this process through an analysis of a wide range of representations--literature, literary histories, periodical publications, scientific texts, national symbols, museums, architectural monuments, and tourist routes--that formed the basis of transnational connections and exchange. The book breaks new ground by addressing the ramifications of Spain's imperial project in relation to its former colonies, not only in Spanish America, but also in North Africa and the Philippines, thus generating new insights into the circuits of cultural exchange that link these four geographical areas that are rarely considered together.

  {"id":"williamsCapitalismSlavery1994","abstract":"Slavery helped finance the Industrial Revolution in England. Plantation owners, shipbuilders, and merchants connected with the slave trade accumulated vast fortunes that established banks and heavy industry in Europe and expanded the reach of capitalism worldwide. Eric Williams advanced these powerful ideas in Capitalism and Slavery, published in 1944. Years ahead of its time, his profound critique became the foundation for studies of imperialism and economic development. Binding an economic view of history with strong moral argument, Williams's study of the role of slavery in financing the Industrial Revolution refuted traditional ideas of economic and moral progress and firmly established the centrality of the African slave trade in European economic development. He also showed that mature industrial capitalism in turn helped destroy the slave system. Establishing the exploitation of commercial capitalism and its link to racial attitudes, Williams employed a historicist vision that set the tone for future studies. In a new introduction, Colin Palmer assesses the lasting impact of Williams's groundbreaking work and analyzes the heated scholarly debates it generated when it first appeared.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Eric"}],"call-number":"HC 254.5 .W53","citation-key":"williamsCapitalismSlavery1994","contributor":[{"literal":"JSTOR"}],"event-place":"Chapel Hill","ISBN":"978-1-4696-1949-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"The University of North Carolina Press","publisher-place":"Chapel Hill","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Capitalism and Slavery.","type":"book","URL":"https://login.proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469619491_williams"},

  {"id":"williamsDecontainmentStasisNarcoAccumulation2018","abstract":"In recent years the fields of journalism, sociology, and literary studies have attempted to offer definitions of the kind of conflict evidenced in the Mexican “narco-wars.” This essay is an attempt to not only give priority to the empirical, but also to call attention to the fact that the problem of contemporary paramilitarism, of “men with guns,” is essentially philosophical in nature. Without addressing this reality first, there can be no understanding of the conflict. Building on a discussion of Giorgio Agamben's work on civil war, this essay argues that the conflict associated with the narco-wars in contemporary Mexico and Central America marks a limit for the conceptual vocabulary of political modernity, a point of no return to which the dialectical machine of modern political reason—which, since Hobbes, has worked to translate violence (or its imminent threat) into the legitimacy of sovereign order—finds itself incapable of responding. For this reason, contemporary political reflection—represented here in the works of Giorgio Agamben and Dawn Paley—has encountered considerable difficulty acknowledging the degree to which emergent forms of violence compel us to question the existing concepts through which political thought seeks to understand conflict. In the wake of Carlo Galli's reading of the legacies of Carl Schmitt, this essay proposes that in globalization we are finally experiencing the eclipse of one of the foundational metaphysical structures of political theology: the Paulist katechon , or sovereign restraining force. It is in the context of this eclipse that political thinking per se can be abandoned in favor of the infrapolitical.","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Gareth"}],"citation-key":"williamsDecontainmentStasisNarcoAccumulation2018","container-title":"Global South","DOI":"10.2979/globalsouth.12.2.05","ISSN":"19328648","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"90-108","title":"Decontainment, Stasis, and Narco-Accumulation","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"zackPhenomenologyRace2017","abstract":"There are several misunderstandings regarding phenomenological approaches to the study of race—particularly the view that such research is a form of “applied” European or Euro-continental philosophy. Building on earlier work on racism as a form of bad faith and the philosophical anthropology of such a critique, an Africana existential phenomenological exploration of the study of race, racism, and the power dynamics behind their manifestations helps shift the Euro-centrism of contemporary phenomenology. An objection to the Afro-pessimistic assertion of blackness as social death can thus be raised from a Fanonian phenomenological perspective: Why must the social world be premised on the attitudes and perspectives of antiblack racists? Why don’t blacks among each other and other communities of color count as a social perspective?","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zack","given":"Naomi"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Lewis"}],"citation-key":"zackPhenomenologyRace2017","contributor":[{"family":"Zack","given":"Naomi"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Lewis"}],"DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190236953.013.53","edition":"1","ISBN":"9780190236953","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Phenomenology and Race","type":"document","URL":"http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190236953.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190236953-e-53"},
  {"id":"zamalinAntiracismIntroduction2019","abstract":"Racism is America's original and most enduring sin, with well-known historic and contemporary markers: slavery, lynching, Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, police brutality. Yet a resurgence of white racism in the twenty-first century, from white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia, to the skyrocketing number of hate crimes being reported around the country, has also brought into sharp relief another uniquely American tradition: antiracism. In Anticracism, Alex Zamalin tells the powerful story of this political theory and practice. He examines the way in which the black antiracist tradition has strongly engaged questions of freedom, equality, justice, struggle, and political hope in dark times. Through a study of major figures, texts and political movements, he traces the history of antislavery abolition, black socialism, and the civil rights movement, leading all the way up to the contemporary Movement for Black Lives.","author":[{"family":"Zamalin","given":"Alex"}],"call-number":"E 184 .A1 Z36 2019","citation-key":"zamalinAntiracismIntroduction2019","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-4798-4928-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Antiracism: an introduction","title-short":"Antiracism","type":"book"},

Liberal Atlantic revolutions of the nineteenth century prompted American colonies‟ choice of political independence. Independence was presented by the rising nationalism as independence revolutions or revolutionary independence wars. It is argued in this article that these were civil wars of independence from where a new political system emerged and that despite the liberal ideas, it continued with a slavery regime. The article also discusses the use made of the political figure of Bolivar to hide the fact that there was a big change in the structures of the economic system and land ownership.

  {"id":"zizekTarryingNegativeKant1993","abstract":"In the space of barely more than five years, with the publication of four pathbreaking books, Slavoj Žižek has earned the reputation of being one of the most arresting, insightful, and scandalous thinkers in recent memory. Perhaps more than any other single author, his writings have constituted the most compelling evidence available for recognizing Jacques Lacan as the preemient philosopher of our time.In Tarrying with the Negative, Žižek challenges the contemporary critique of ideology, and in doing so opens the way for a new understanding of social conflict, particularly the recent outbursts of nationalism and ethnic struggle. Are we, Žižek asks, confined to a postmodern universe in which truth is reduced to the contingent effect of various discursive practices and where our subjectivity is dispersed through a multitude of ideological positions? No is his answer, and the way out is a return to philosophy. This revisit to German Idealism allows Žižek to recast the critique of ideology as a tool for disclosing the dynamic of our society, a crucial aspect of which is the debate over nationalism, particularly as it has developed in the Balkans—Žižek's home. He brings the debate over nationalism into the sphere of contemporary cultural politics, breaking the impasse centered on nationalisms simultaneously fascistic and anticolonial aspirations. Provocatively, Žižek argues that what drives nationalistic and ethnic antagonism is a collectively driven refusal of our own enjoyment.Using examples from popular culture and high theory to illuminate each other—opera, film noir, capitalist universalism, religious and ethnic fundamentalism—this work testifies to the fact that, far more radically than the postmodern sophists, Kant and Hegel are our contemporaries.","author":[{"family":"Zizek","given":"Slavoj"}],"citation-key":"zizekTarryingNegativeKant1993","ISBN":"978-0-8223-8182-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993,10,19]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"302","publisher":"Duke University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Tarrying with the Negative: Kant, Hegel, and the Critique of Ideology","title-short":"Tarrying with the Negative","type":"book"},
